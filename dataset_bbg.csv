Yamal came into the match after an impressive performance against Betis last time out and kept his place in the starting XI.
It proved to be a good selection by Xavi as Lamine showed once again just how much talent he possesses with a superb strike.
The 16-year-old raced down the right, cut inside and fired a low shot across goal and past goalkeeper Unai Simon.
It was the sort of goal that reminded you of a certain Lionel Messi....check it out below:

“There are all kinds of reports, but I don’t think that’s even allowed by FIFA,” Laporta said.
However, Laporta re-stated his willingness to stage some sort of event to give the GOAT a proper send-off.
“I don’t know if it will be when we return to the Spotify Camp Nou at the end of 2024 or when the stadium is fully built by July 2026,” the president concluded.
Barcelona’s iconic stadium is being refurbished, meaning the club is currently playing at nearby Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc.

Here’s what Suarez has had to say about his latest move:
“I’m very happy and excited to take on this new challenge with Inter Miami. I can’t wait to get started, and I’m ready to work to make the dream of winning more titles with this great Club a reality. I’m optimistic about what we can achieve together with our shared ambition,” he told the club’s media.
“I will give my all to bring joy to these great fans I’ve heard so much about while I wear Inter Miami colors, and look forward to reuniting with great friends and players. I’m also eager to meet my new teammates and coaches.”
Suarez had long talked about how he and Messi dreamed of retiring together and it seems the two good friends will now be granted that wish.

He signed with Inter Miami CF instead, and the rest is history. Today, he was announced as the winner of TIME Magazine’s Athlete of the Year, the first football (soccer) player to be given the honor.
“The truth is that fortunately, I had several options on the table that were interesting, and I had to analyze them and think, even weigh them up with my family, before making the final decision to come to Miami,” he toldTIME.
Barcelona promised Messi they would clear enough salary space to sign him in accordance with La Liga’s FFP rules. But they did not offer him a contract to sign. In fact, they couldn’t, until they cleared enough space.
Messi was not comfortable with the situation of having to force players out. Plus, there was a similar incident back in 2021. Barcelona promised him he’d be able to sign a new contract with them, but ultimately told him at the end it was not going to happen. That’s when he left for Paris Saint-Germain.

“I have never had another idol. I once took a photo with him. I was unknown. Maybe one day I will be like him.”
Yamal also vowed that he will win the Golden Boy award in the future after picking up ‘The Youngest’ award this time around.

Messi took the award instead and spoke kindly about Lewandowski, saying how he had deserved it the previous year when it was cancelled due to the pandemic.
Lewandowski reportedly questioned whether Messi’s words were sincere, comments he has since said were misinterpreted, which did not go down well with the GOAT.
The ill-feeling between the two players seemd to linger and was spotted when Argentina took on Poland at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
Messi   Lewandowski#CopaMundialFIFA|#Qatar2022
Messi has now admitted he did target Lewandowski during the game because he was pretty mad at the striker.
“Lewandowski’s statement in 2021 bothered me because when I won the Ballon d’Or I said what I really felt,” he told ESPN.
“I ignored him during the game because it was him and I was angry and thought he shouldn’t have said what he said. I was very angry. If I was deliberately dribbling because it was him? Yes.
“After that we met and talked and agreed that it was a misunderstanding. He was upset because what he said didn’t match what was reported. Then he went to Barcelona and we talked about many things about the club, the city and everything.”
Messi’s Argentina team-mate Angel Di Maria has also recently said the GOAT deliberately targeted Lewandowski during the game.
“Even my grandma noticed that Messi was purposely taunting Lewandowski. It’s a thing he does sometimes,” he said in a Star+ documentary .Champions, a year later.’
“When you speak about him, he tries to talk on the pitch. Sometimes, people don’t respect Messi and don’t know that he’s the best player of all time. You can’t Leo him anything because he get’s angry, and it’s worse for them.”

The rival was New Caledonia, by far the weakest team in the group, but it was reassuring for Brazil to win in resounding fashion: 9-0.
In the first matchday, Messinho was a substitute and his side let slip a 2-0 lead to eventually lose 2-3 to Iran.
Against New Caledonia, he was a starter and scored a goal and set up three more before being taken off before the hour mark.
This could signal that coach Phelipe Leal is thinking of using him as a starter once again in a crucial match against England. It’s likely the Brazilians will need to win against the current group leaders to avoid an embarrassing group stage exit.
The sixteen-year-old currently plays for Palmeiras, but it’sno secretthat FC Barcelona is tracking him. He’s also made no secret of his admiration for the Catalan club, and in particular, for one Lionel Messi. It’s said he’s based his style of play on his idol, thus his nickname.
Recently, however, Deco has shot down rumors of an impending transfer. He said the club is not following young stars since the academy is producing many of them. Rather, they are looking to plug holes of immediate need in the first team.

Lionel Messi reached history in the 21stminute, as a free kick by the Argentina was beautifully over theSevillawall and past a reaching Beto for the golazo and the 1-0 lead. With the goal, Messi tied Telmo Zarra's record for most goals in the history of La Liga with 251 goals. Grande D10S!

Lionel Messi is now tied with Telmo Zarra atop La Liga's all-time scoring charts (251 goals). Here's how he did it:https://t.co/5ZAnNyowQt


In the second half, Sevilla equalized thanks to a sloppy defensive play byBarcelona, which lead to aJordi Albaown goal. It was a complete defensive breakdown to make it 1-1. Just two minutes later, Neymar gave Barça the lead as his header via a free kick gave the home side the lead once again. It was Neymar's first ever Liga goal via the header. Ivan Rakitic made it 3-1 in the 65thminute as a lovely lob pass by Luis Suarez found the head of Rakitic. Respect to Ivan as well for not celebrating the goal against his former team.
In the 72ndminute, history was made...
Lionel Messi scored his 252ndgoal in La Liga. Neymar with the assist. Leo's teammates grabbed him and lifted him up in celebration. History at the Camp Nou, as Lionel Messi writes another chapter in his glorious career.

Xoel's thoughts onLionel Messi'shistoric moment
We, as a sports society and culture in today's social media-driven world, tend to only remember moments, and forget the every day things that makes our sports lives special. While YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other social media has brought us videos, images, and tweets that keep memories alive forever, it also has led us to only remember those particular good and/or bad moments, and don't put things in perspective. For example, how many times have you heard people say ""____ is the greatest _____ ever"" and you cringe because that person is either too young or too ignorant to recognize that not everything that has occurred recently or over the past 10-15 years is not the definitive span of history. It's annoying, dumb, and it is an example of what is wrong with today's society's idea of what history is.

#D10SRT@espnstatsinfo: Look at how young Leo#Messiis compared to other prominent record-setters in sports historypic.twitter.com/xBK6dqBwi3


I'm 31 years of age, so I wasn't alive when Pelé was a footballer. Diego Maradona was past his prime when I was a child, remembering the few games I was able to see him play in the early 1990s.
For me to say ""Lionel Messi is the greatest of all time"" is easy because A.) I love Leo and FC Barcelona, and B.) I never saw the two other players that are considered the greatest play in their prime, only relying on word of mouth, highlights, and history books. But with all the records Lionel Messi has broken at his young age, with all the trophies he has won, with everything he has had to overcome in his life, and with all of the football historians and ex-football greats stating the same and not to mention the role model and humble person Lionel Messi is, I can say with confidence that Lionel Andres Messi is the greatest footballer the world has ever seen and maybe will ever see. I feel so blessed that I am alive to witness this era, and I hope you feel the same way.

Congratulations, Messi! as he becomes all-time La Liga scoring leader.http://t.co/JoEDdzLuqZhttp://t.co/xptIZQck9jpic.twitter.com/tRty26IH2k


Lionel Messi will always live through our memories and on video, but it's not just because of the goals and the highlights that will make him the greatest of all time—it's also the every game things.
The fact that he is a great teammate.
The fact that he is not selfish and will look for his teammates.
The fact that he does not complain nor try to embarrass a teammate by getting angry on the pitch for the world to see.
The fact that Messi is not afraid of getting in an opponent's face to defend himself, yet he won't do that just to be tough. He'd only do it if the right situation came.
The fact that Leo is a trash-talker and backs it up on the pitch. Just ask Pepe.

Messi and his highlights will always be on YouTube, but don't let those things be the reason you cherish Leo. Cherish him for the every day things he does. For the great role model that he his, the great family man he is, for being so humble, etc. Even enjoy the training sessions he's in. We won't see a player like Lionel Messi ever again, so savor every thing he does and every moment he is in a football kit.

Lionel Messi continues to do the amazing: to continue to amaze the world when the world thinks it has seen everything from him. At 27, Leo has many years of football left; yet, it feels like Messi has accomplished things only a rare exceptional player in his late 30s/early 40s could only reach. There are still many more records for Leo to break, and more trophies to win. Messi will continue to inspire us, and it isourresponsibility—we, true fans—to put his accomplishments in the right perspective. We are living in the Messi era, and we will be the ones that will give justice to Messi's greatness as we all get older to tell new generations about Lionel Messi's legacy. It is on us to not let Messi's legacy rely on his highlights, as great of highlights as they are. Messi's legacy is more than highlights and stats. Messi's legacy is everything he has done, the present, and what he will do to inspire us in the future both on and off the pitch. Lionel Messi is a legacy.

Lionel Messi overcame great odds, illness, moving to a new country and new continent, being away from his family, competing with others at La Masia, and so many other things to become the greatest ever. Leo has truly been blessed, and by his blessing, we have all been blessed to witness the rise of a legend.

Messi is now the leading all-time scorer in La Liga...at the age of 27. Proving the impossible is indeed possible.


There will always be people that will say Lionel Messi still needs to win the World Cup to truly be the greatest ever. Yes, a World Cup win would solidify the argument of Leo being the greatest ever. But for me and for most of the footballing world, the verdict is in: Lionel Messi is King of Football Kings. 253 goals and counting in La Liga.
UPDATE:Lionel Messi is now the all-time leading goal-scorer in the history of the UEFA Champions League, as he got his 72nd goal of his CL career against APOEL on Tuesday night. Messi surpassed Real Madrid hero Raul for the record. Leo scored two more goals in the second half to grab his second hat trick in four days and extend the CL goal-scoring record to 74 goals. Messi = Legend.
We love you, Leo.
Thank you for bringing us so many great moments and for the everyday moments some of us may take for granted.
Thank you, Leo, for being a great role model who inspires us that anything is possible.
Thank you, Leo, for the future happiness you'll bring us as well.
Most of all: Thank you, Lionel Andres Messi, for simply being you.
Eres el mejor de todos los tiempos.
You are the greatest of all time.

The GOAT may sadly no longer be a Barcelona player, but the club is still having a clear influence on his life as well as his children’s.
Here’s what he’s sad to say about parenthood.
“I think I am a good father and I try to pass on to my children the values ​​they taught me when I was young. I follow the approach of the club I grew up in, Barça… Barça’s values ​​are very important,” he said.
Messi also showed off his famous Barcelona tattoo on his leg, adding: “Look, I got this tattoo to show my love for the club that made me who I am.”
The GOAT is currently enjoying life in America at Inter Miami but did glimpse into the future when asked if he’d make the next World Cup.
“I’m not thinking about the next World Cup yet, it’s far. About the upcoming Copa America, yes. It’s going to be nice. After that, we will see, depending on how I am. The years have passed and we have to see how I feel, I’ll see it day by day,” he added.
“I don’t want to think about the after. I want to enjoy it as much as I can, what I like the most is playing.”

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/fc-barcelona-transfer-rumours-news/2014/4/18/5627392/lionel-messi-transfer-psg-manchester-city,On Lionel Messi and Transfer Rumours,188.74.210.207,"Apr 18, 2014","In the wake of FCBarcelona’s simultaneously gradual and sudden fall from grace, the media have been having a field day, speculating on the future of virtually everyone involved at the club. From the incumbent Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu to the club’s Sporting Director, former club legend, Andoni Zubizarreta and the Blaugrana head coach,Gerardo Martino, it appears as though no-one is safe from these malicious rumours.
Not even Barça’s star player,Lionel Messi.
Following a few low-key performances, both in the UEFA Champions League against Atletico Madrid, in La Liga againstGranadaCF, and most recently in the Copa del Rey final againstReal Madrid, Lionel Messi has been the subject of criticism, from fans and journalists alike. His work ethic has declined ever since Pep Guardiola left the club in 2012, while his goalscoring form has also taken a hit – at least by his absurdly high standards.
By all accounts, this is not the same Lionel Messi that tortured defenses and set all manner of records in 2011 and 2012. Heck, this isn’t even the same Messi that we saw last season, or even a short month ago. Something isn’t right, and despite concurrently pointing the finger at Gerardo Martino for his tactical naivety, the media seem convinced that Messi’s problems are all of his own doing.
That’s not to say that I solely blame Martino for the problems that we as a club, and Messi as an individual is experiencing on the field – but let’s be honest, he’s certainly been a major contributing factor. Unlike Guardiola, and even unlike Vilanova, Martino’s regime has not been able to get the best out of Lionel Messi.
For a club that has attempted to delicately traverse the thin line betweenmessidependenciaand extracting the very best from the greatest player of all time, this season could have been a rousing success. The signing of Neymar looked to alleviate the pressure on Messi, and in a sense, it has done just that – but without tangible success (trophies) to point to, one might argue that this club, at least at the moment, is better when totally reliant upon Lionel Messi.
For example, who can legitimately argue that this season has been more successful than the previous?
Even if Tito’s Barcelona were dependent upon Messi, their reliance on the Argentine superstar carried them to the La Liga title and to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. It wasn’t always pretty, and it was rarely convincing, particularly after the turn of the year, but it was at least successful.
And so, facing a season of disappointment, it was predictable that the media would turn on someone, and that the fans would follow suit. But who could have ever expected that Lionel Messi would be in the firing line?
Yet, within these rumours and this criticism lies a certain irony. Subtle, yet present with every column inch and every tweet. The flaws in the logic are numerous, obvious, and yet somehow hidden to some Culés. I might not be a journalist and heck, I might not even be a particularly good blogger, but I have learnt a few things about this ""world"" and how it works.
Transfer rumours sell; it’s a simple premise, one that plays on the most a few of the most basic human emotions: hope, anger and curiosity. Hope that your club will signthatplayer, anger that your club might sellthisplayer and thanks to well-written headlines, oftentimes curiosity: justwhohave my club been linked with?Whoare my club looking to sell? Our primitive desire to learn has us clicking the links, fuelling a business that, ironically, rarely teaches anyone anything.
Just think of the number of central defenders that Barcelona has been linked with in the past few seasons. Now compare that astronomical figure to the number of actual signings – while there may have been legitimate interest in a few of those players, the bulk of those rumours were mere fabrications. But, thanks to the behaviour of the general public, these rumours will have probably been amongst the most popular pages on that publication’s website.
The same premise applies to the dying art of newspaper publication – a front page emblazoned with a teasing headline and well-written lede on the latest transfer rumour is far more likely to sell than another front page that promises an in-depth tactical analysis. It’s the nature of the beast – quick and cheap always defeats long and informative, simply because the latter will always be a niche area in this world.
Whether it’s amongst friends at school, or around the proverbial water-cooler at work; there’s going to be more conversation about unsubstantiated transfer gossip than there is about the relative merits and demerits of adopting a 4-3-3 in today’s footballing world.
And with transfer rumours firmly embedded in our culture, it’s no longer enough for outlets to simply publish any old rumour. In fact, the most legitimate of stories will be prominent in all media outlets; last summer for instance, you could have read about Barcelona’s pursuit of Neymar in any one of thousands of newspapers or websites. So how does Diario Sport for example, differentiate itself from, let’s say, Marca?
To their credit I suppose, the large outlets are relatively well-connected. The very best journalists in this field areenchufado– plugged in. They know what’s exactly what’s going on, and if there’s a semblance of truth in the story, they can provide genuinely informative articles. But what if you aren’tenchufado? What happens when you’re a smaller outlet, trying to gain ground and stay afloat in this ruthless business?
Why you stand up and fight of course.
Shock and awe as a military doctrine was created in the 1990’s by the National Defense University in the Unites States. Borrowing a few key concepts from the decidedly German tactic of Blitzkreig, infamous for its usage throughout World War II, shock and awe has been used to great effect by the US military in countless scenarios – basing its success on the use of spectacular displays of force to paralyze the enemy’s perception of the battlefield.
Amazingly, all four key characteristics of establishing what the US military defined as rapid dominance can be applied to the world of journalism, and transfer rumours in particular.
With near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of themselves, other media outlets and the publishing environment, underlined by the rapidity, timeliness and operational brilliance in execution coupled with near or total control of the entire environment, any outlet can establish rapid dominance in their field thanks to these shock and awe tactics.
And just think to yourself, doesn’t this sound a little familiar?
The best journalists understand the environment in which they work. Moving quickly to capitalise on Messi’s recent poor form, an individual will have started this rumour after the Real Madrid defeat, timing it perfectly to coincide with Culés growing dissatisfaction and continuing distrust with the current board, executing the story well, before publishing ahead of all other competitors, thereby establishing control in the environment.
When faced with this rumour, Culés and neutrals everywhere couldn’t help but buy in. Hehaslooked disinterested, the boarddoesseem that stupid and Paris Saint-Germain have both the moneyandthe interest in pulling this deal off. Their perception has been compromised, despite the fact that this rumour is manifestly absurd.
Think about it for a second.
Not once in his Barcelona career has Lionel Messi even suggested that he would consider a move away from Catalunya.
Just recently, Messi declared his interest in ending his career at the club.
The thought of Lionel Messi seriously contemplating a move away from FC Barcelona is both implausible in general, and entirely ludicrous given the context. This is a player who is constantly looking forward to the next game. This is a player who cannot wait for the next training session, and this is a player who has placed great importance on the upcomingFIFA World Cupin Brazil.
The idea that he is sitting at home and planning a move to Paris or Manchester severely juxtaposes that very characteristic; the one that Messi has continuously displayed from the moment he first kicked a football as a child.
Especially given the barriers to such a move.
Lionel Messi is Argentine; he speaks Spanish, and almost certainly learnt to speak Catalan having moved to Barcelona over a decade ago. His grasp of English is limited at very best, while his knowledge of French is probably non-existent. Moving to another country, and moving to either Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain would necessitate learning an entirely new language.
Given that a supposed key reason behind his departure would be the disconnect he feels with the club and the fans, it’s difficult to imagine Messi feeling any different in Paris or in England. At least initially anyway. And again, the concept of learning a new language is an unnecessary and entirely uncharacteristic distraction ahead of the World Cup.
So too is the prospect of uprooting his entire family. His father, his girlfriend, his child; all live in Barcelona with him. How would they feel about moving to a decidedly different culture? The prospect is unlikely to be appealing to say the very least – which is especially true where Manchester is concerned.
I don’t doubt his ability to socialise and fit in anywhere, but Messi is widely regarded as a shy individual; leaving his lifelong friends and teammates again seems out of character. For a believable rumour, it seems slightly odd that we have to disregard practically everything we know, or think we know about Lionel Messi.
After all, the onus would be on Messi to force the move, particularly with Barcelona currently facing a transfer ban. Assuming the Blaugrana can still sell players, it’s malicious and baseless to even hint that the board would consider a sale without an opportunity to purchase a replacement.
But, once the rumour starts, the other outlets will become aware, and to stay competitive, they too must report on the story. It’s either that, or run the risk that readers will look elsewhere – and in doing so, the rumour ironically gains momentum. With each new report, each rewritten article, the rumour supposedly gains credibility – it’s a self-sustaining cycle.
Unfortunately, there are no signs that change is on its way. Informative, value-add journalism will remain a niche area; even if it gains ground, it will remain buried beneath the theatre of mainstream journalism, suffocated by meaningless gossip and denigrated by association.
Until change does come, do yourself a favour. Be smart: don’t believe everything you read.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/fc-barcelona-transfer-rumours-news/2015/1/5/7496127/lionel-messi-chelsea-transfer,"On ""Lionel Messi to Chelsea""",188.74.210.21,"Jan  5, 2015","It’s been a tough day for FCBarcelona. The reaction to last night’s defeat againstReal Sociedadhas been predictably brutal; Culés were baying for blood and they’ve got their wish. Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta has been sacked, dismissed from his role with immediate effect; gone too is his assistant,Carles Puyolwho has left of his own volition – arguably before he too was pushed by the board.
Indeed, it’s surprising to see so many Culés rejoicing in the news as a sign of progress in their continuing battle against incumbent club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu. ""Bartomeu"", they say, ""you’re next"" – wilfully ignoring the fact that Zubizarreta hasn’t been sacked by the fans; rather Bartomeu himself was the only man capable of making the decision. Criticism from the stands didn’t force Bartomeu’s hand, indeed everything suggests at an internal disagreement being the straw that broke the camel’s back.
So, Culés, Bartomeu probably won’t be next. At least not now, and not until at least the end of the season either. Even then, no elections have been formally announced as of yet; so as things stand, Bartomeu will continue as club president for years to come.
Irrespective, this complex, dramatic day is as sure a sign as any that this club is currently in turmoil. There are power struggles internally, externally; at board-room level, in the crowds and reportedly even in the dressing room. For now though, all we have are rumours. Reported ""news"" stories purporting to carry the facts, the juicy behind-the-scenes gossip from inside the Camp Nou; all being penned by media outlets, or at its worst by journalists, with their own agenda.
As per usual, the media won’t ever let the truth stand between them and promoting that agenda when they see an opportunity. Plant a story, stir the pot, sit back, open the popcorn and enjoy. Rinse, repeat.
Case in point: today’s developments involvingLionel Messi. After being benched byLuis Enriquelast night, reports emerged claiming that Messi had fallen out with Enrique and is ""holding monumental anger"" towards his coach. Let’s forget all we know about Lionel Messi. You know...the part where he’s a reserved kind of guy, a guy who has always respected authority and never once questioned his manager.
He was left out of the squad by Frank Rijkaard for the 2006 UEFA Champions League final; he was unhappy, but never once did he hold any ill-will towards the Dutchman. Under Pep Guardiola andTito Vilanova, Messi thrived. The same could be said about his time under Gerardo Martino. At an international level, Messi was mismanaged by countless coaches and to this day he hasn’t said a single bad word about any one of them.
But of course, Messiisangry at Luis Enrique according to these reports – after all, these reports originate from such a reliable, credible source: Cadena COPE. Oh wait, is this the same Cadena COPE that’s reportedly on theReal Madridpayroll? Is this the same Cadena COPE that falsely accused FC Barcelona and its players of doping during their glory years under Pep Guardiola?
That’s right, it’s those guys – back again, reportedly close to Lionel Messi or other sources at the club they defamed and by whom they were sued just a few years ago!
Or maybe they’re back at their old game, baselessly attempting to destabilise FC Barcelona to promote their own, pro-Real Madrid, right-wing agenda?
It seems like a non-story at best, which brings us nicely onto Lionel Messi following Chelsea on Instagram. After all, if he was going to leave his boyhood club, the one that he has repeatedly stated his desire at which he wishes to end his career, he would join the club that the majority of Culés despise, right?
I hear what you’re saying – this isn’t about the fans, it’s about the board, that’s the reason why Messi reportedly wants to leave. So then, why would he join the club managed by Jose Mourinho, a man who was backed for the FC Barcelona job ahead of Pep Guardiola by public enemy number one and Bartomeu’s close friend, Sandro Rosell?
That's right, because ""Messi to Chelsea"" is a story that’s far more click-worthy and is going to sell far more newspapers than ""Messi stays at FC Barcelona""...

Almost entirely out of nowhere, it has emerged today that the Spanish state is investigatingBarcelona'sstar striker,Lionel Messiand his father/agent, Jorge Messi for allegedly defrauding the state of over €4 million worth of income taxes between 2007 and 2009. As per the information reported in El Mundo Deportivo, the figure allegedly stands at €4,164,674.96 - as Messi and his father are alleged to have filed fraudulent tax returns between 2007 and 2009. It is suspected that Messi and his father used companies abroad - specifically in Belize and Uruguay - to sell the player's image rights. As a result of these alleged actions, Messi and his father avoided paying that €4 million tax bill to the Spanish Treasury.
In a message on his Facebook page, Lionel Messi refuted the claims:""We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities. We are surprised about those news, because we have never committed any infringement.

On one side of the field you had Messi and Friends, and all-star team, captained by our very own Lionel Messi, and on the other, you had Neymar and Friends, another all-star team, this time captained by, you guessed it, Neymar.
And as is always the case, this friendly match was packed with goals and entertainment -- the final score in Peru was 8-5 to Messi's team -- but the unquestionable highlight was the final goal of the match, as Neymar delighted the crowd with an audacious lob from just inside the opposition's half. Assisted byBarcelona'sDani Alves, Neymar displayed fantastic technique, perfectly executing this spectacular effort to bring the deficit to three. Full highlights of the match can be found below:

But forLionel Messi, it was potentially the end of a part of his career.
After 120 minutes of battle, Argentina lost to Chile 4-2 in penalties. For the third straight year, Argentina lost a third straight final.
After the match, the talk wasn't about Chile's back-to-back titles, it was what Messi said after the match. Messi told TyC Sports his time with the Argentine national team was over.
It's possible Messi has made a decision in the heat of the moment. He just lost another final and his frustration is at a peak.
But maybe he's serious and this is it.
The though of not ever seeing Lionel Messi wearing an Albiceleste kit is inconceivable.
Then again, Messi has made a career of making the football impossible possible.
Honestly, when Gonzalo Higuain missed the one-on-one chance in the first half, I felt that the night was not going to end well for Argentina. I just kept thinking it can't be just bad luck.
It was an omen.




Angel Di Maria wasn't 100 percent and was subbed out. Another final lost for ""El Fideo."" Sergio Aguero came on and once again, another disappointing performance.
What made the night even worse was Messi's penalty kick. Leo sent the ball into the New Jersey sky, and with that, Messi's night ended with disappointment.
It was more than bad luck. It was destiny.
For someone who's won it all atBarcelona, it feels odd that Messi could not win a title with his national team. Then again, Argentina is obviously not FC Barcelona. But with all of the talent Argentina offers, you'd think at least the Albiceleste could've won a title.
But as the old saying goes: Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.
The talent at Argentina did not work hard enough on the pitch to win a title. Sure, many of the players tried hard during all three finals, Messi included, but those same players did not execute the finish. How does a team that normally scores three to four goals a match suddenly freeze in a final? Call it a choke, call it a weakness, call it whatever you want. There may not be a better word to define this generation's Argentine national team other than disappointing.
To see Messi cry was tough. He's a hero at Barcelona. But with Argentina, he's seen by some as a disappointment, a bottler, a choke artist, etc. Not everyone loves Leo, and in Argentina, he's not as appreciated as he is in Barcelona. Expectations were always so high, and unfortunately, it seems like Messi will never fulfill those expectations, fair or unfair.

Here's what Lionel Messi has had to say on his decision to retire from international football#SSNHQpic.twitter.com/7ik9Fd2aSM


Of course, Barcelona fans were upset to see Messi cry because we want to see him get some sort of success with his national team. It seemed unfair to see Messi cry at the end of the match. But let's tell the truth, it was not unfair. Messi missed his penalty, his teammates didn't step up and Argentina deserved to lose. Credit must be given to Chile. They played better overall in the match and finished the job in penalties. Again, it was disappointing for Messi, but not unfair.
I now truly believe it is not meant to be for Lionel Messi to win a major title with Argentina. It can't just be bad luck anymore. Bad luck is temporary, but what Messi and this generation's Argentina team have endured is more than just bad luck. Why? Who knows. In sports, and in life, there are questions there are no answers to.
I hope Lionel Messi reconsiders and continues with the Argentine national team. But if it's truly the end, no one — and I meanno one— can say he didn't give everything he had. Messi gave 10 years to his national team. I know some will say he didn't, but I could care less about what those haters say. Three straight international finals is no small feat. Some will say, ""Yeah, but he didn't win a final."" What can we say? That's true. It's a shame and it will be the blemish in Messi's football career.
Still, Messi gave his all and left if all on the pitch. Those tears running down Leo's face were his pain, his sacrifice, his passion for his country, and his sadness knowing he was unable to bring his country a title.
The look on Messi's face seemed to express someone accepting one's sad fate. It hurt to watch — painful, if you will.

Más no puedes hacer, Leo. Gracias por todo, algún día la ganaráspic.twitter.com/MHXNEKd6rg


Leo Messi's heart has now been broken three times in three years. After a decade of service for the Argentine national team, maybe he's come to the realization that he gave all he had for the Albiceleste. Sadly, his all wasn't enough, it's a shame and there's nothing more is left to be said about it.
For three straight finals in three straight years:
Angel Di Maria was hurt (didn't even play in WC 2014 Final).
Sergio ""Kun"" Aguero did not perform to certain expectations.
Gonzalo Higuain missed a sitter that would've won Argentina a title.
Argentina couldn't win in 90 minutes.
Argentina couldn't win in 120 minutes, with two years in a row of losing in penalties.
Argentina was shut out.
Argentina lost in heart-breaking fashion.




Maybe some things are not meant to be.
For Lionel Messi, winning a title with the Argentine national team may not be in his destiny.
If Messi does come back to the Albiceleste, he'll come back to try and give his country the title they've been waiting for.
If anyone can change this Argentine generation's destiny of losing, it's Leo.
As I previously said, Lionel Messi — the greatest footballer ever — has made a career of making the football impossible possible.

The pick of the bunch, the crème de la crème; the best player in the world.Barcelonahave their nonpareil centre-forward:Lionel Messi. His influence is unrivalled; La Pulga is undoubtedly the foremost player in a generation stacked with talent.
The Argentine maestro plays football as if it is a work of art; each swing of his boot like the delicate caress of an artist’s brush on the canvas. Each pass chipping away at the opposition as if they are made of marble, and he is Michelangelo. Every goal is a building block; lifting the diminutive forward closer to the heavens. Even at the tender age of 25, Lionel Messi is already seen as a footballing God – and with good reason too.
His reputation is beyond compare, even at a club that has seen countless world-class players don the famous Blaugrana jersey. FC Barcelona has been home to the original Ronaldo, in what some consider the finest season of his career. Fellow Brazilians Rivaldo and Ronaldinho graced the Camp Nou in their prime, dazzling crowds with their skill and imagination.
Xavi Hernández, Andrés Iniesta,Carles Puyol, even Josep Guardiola himself; all pale in comparison to the great Lionel Messi. The records he has set are likely to be insurmountable; his trophy haul (both individually and as part of a collective) will put any player to shame and with this, his fourth consecutive Ballon d’Or, Messi has surely secured his place in the pantheon of all-time greats.
Seldom have we seen a footballer with such finesse in the final third and never before have we seen a player this clinical, or a striker who is this creative; he truly is one-of-a-kind. Just when you think he has reached his peak, Messi continues to improve – and he does so at an alarming rate, smashing records as he goes.
Who knows? Maybe this award can be taken as an indication that Lionel Messi is already the greatest player to ever grace the game – certainly this writer thinks so – but in truth, does it really matter? You might prefer Pele, Maradona, or evenCristiano Ronaldo– it makes no difference, for we all know that whenever Messi takes the field, there is only one winner and that’s football.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IbA_cuM-Fx9F9zC0dDyAKpVsUto=/31x0:561x353/320x213/filters:focal(31x0:561x353)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/6199151/bab2uhaceaapmtv.0.jpg

Despite breaking a plethora of records in 2012 and claiming a record fourth Ballon d’Or in January, Messi’s salary has not increased, while his buyout clause reportedly remains at a surprisingly low €250 million. The new deal – which was announced by the club in December – therefore expires in 2018.
This is Messi’s sixth contract extension in the past eight seasons, and as expected, it has been well-received by everyone involved with the club. After all, who wouldn’t want Lionel Messi to remain at the club for as long as possible? As Jordi Alba so succinctly put it, ""He is the best player in the world and as long as nothing happens, he’ll be the best ever"".

Messi and his father have been accused of alleged tax evasion, but because the prosecutor argued that Lionel was not aware of any wrongdoing and would only look to push forward with the case against Messi's father, Jorge.
But the court today ruled that Lionel could've known about his father's plans and could've even approved the creation of a web of shell companies in order to evade taxes due on income from image rights. Both Lionel and Jorge have denied any wrongdoing, but the case will continue against both of them. The whole process started last year when the two were accused of defrauding the Spanish state of more than €4 million.
Even though the court has decided to pursue the case against the four time Ballon d'Or winner, disregarding the prosecutors notion, it remains highly unlikely that Lionel Messi will be found guilty in the matter. Considering the prosecutors opinion it is clear that he does not want to continue with the case against Lionel and would rather focus on the father. But for now Lionel will have to continue to endure the silliness of these affairs.

However, he denied rumors of a loan or transfer back to the Catalan club.
Speaking on the Offside with Taylor Twellman podcast, Mas said:  ”I don’t know if it’s some type of friendly or farewell game. They have this Gamper Trophy they play for in the summer. But there will be something where, hopefully when the new Camp Nou is open, because their stadium there they will not be playing in for the next year and a half, hopefully, Lionel Messi can say his proper goodbye.”
Messi did not have a farewell game after spending most of his life with the blaugrana. Instead, he was thought to be coming back, but eventually was forced to leave the club in the summer and join Paris Saint-Germain.
“That does not entail playing for Barcelona. He’s not going to go on loan there. That’s not going to happen. Yes, he deserves his correct goodbye there. Yes, and I will do everything in my power in order to facilitate and help him do that,” the Inter Miami chief said.
Messi, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba are staging a reunion in Miami. The trio have joined Inter - last place in their conference in MLS - and have so far led a successful change.

Lamine Yamal has already made historyby becoming the youngest goalscorer in La Liga, and Marquez is confident he has a very bright future ahead of him.
“He belongs to that group of gifted boys who have this innate talent and who no matter how old they are to compete in any category and make a difference,” he told Mundo Deportivo.
“Ronaldinho, Messi... Lamine can be the next. He has all the qualities. Obviously we have to take care of the processes because he is still a child.”
The teenager’s not the only Barca youngster impressing in the first team. Fermin Lopez has also broken into Xavi’s side which has come as a surprise to Marquez.
“It has been surprising. I didn’t have him last year but he had to leave to realize that he had a great opportunity to be in the club,” he added.
“We are all happy with this evolution and that Xavi likes it so much.”
Marquez has had to cope without the duo this season but still has a host of exciting players in his squad such as Marc Guiu, Pau Cubarsi and Noah Darvich.

With the task of equaling the record accomplished, Messi will surely continue playing without the pressure of it looming over him.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2015/10/22/9594068/are-barcelona-better-without-lionel-messi,Are Barça Better Without Messi?,45.155.68.129,"Oct 22, 2015","Anyone who is remotely familiar with Betteridge's law of headlines will be able to see what's coming next; in the title of this article I pitched a question to the world: are FC Barcelona actually better without their superstar striker,Lionel Messi? Of course, the answer is ""no"", and anyone with a working pair of eyes will have witnessed as much over the past couple of weeks, as Barcelona have somewhat lost their invincible aura without Messi spearheading their attack. It's also clear that the Blaugrana are very much a different animal, philosophically speaking, without Messi in the team.
So, with help with our friends from Sportsmatrix, we've delved deeper into the numbers behindBarcelona's2015/16 La Liga performances with and without the four-time Ballon d'Or winner and the results are interesting to say the least:
Maybe you saw some of this coming; certainly, news that Neymar, Luis Suarez and even Ivan Rakitic attempt more shots without Lionel Messi on the field is unlikely to come as a major surprise. However, what is fascinating is that all three actually create more chances for each other and their other teammates without Messi on the field -- which somewhat goes against the trend one might have expected, a trend in which you might have thought that Barcelona create fewer chances per match without the Argentine.
Evidently, the fact of the matter is that Barcelona, while just as creative sans Messi, are simply far less clinical -- a worrying trend that has only been exacerbated with his injury. Not only that, but with Messi out, the Blaugrana's tactical approach has shifted in a bid to keep creating these chances. The prior strategy of deferring to Messi against a stubborn defense simply isn't available, and the only suitable alternative thatLuis Enriquehas found is to open up the game, attack with reckless abandon and simply hope to outscore the opposition.
Yes, I'm simplifying and exaggerating for effect -- but the statistics paint a clear picture: Barcelona play a more open, almost uncontrolled style in a bid to lure opponents out of their shell; it works, and it helps them create chances in the absence of their best player -- but it leaves them equally susceptible at the defensive end and when they fail to convert the chances that they have been creating, bad things happen.
That being said, it's not all bad. Messi's injury has liberated Neymar and brought out the very best from our Brazilian superstar, who has thrived under the added pressure of being the de facto team leader. His four goal haul againstRayo Vallecanowas testament to that and maybe, just maybe, he will be able to continue that form even upon Messi's return.
What do you think Cules? Do you think that Luis Enrique should be changing our style of play without Messi in the team to help secure results, or is the current approach still the best alternative in your eyes?",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-MhyYRfyNyngS_fTZIhXByz1e4=/7x0:2998x1994/320x213/filters:focal(7x0:2998x1994)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/47496401/GettyImages-489682074.0.jpg

Messi has taken MLS by storm, scoring 9 goals in his first six matches as Miami, who are bottom of MLS’s Eastern Conference, have reached a final for the first time ever.
He was asked whether his decision to go to Miami was in part due to wanting to become the face of the sport in the United States.
“My decision to come was based on many things. My family was part of the decision. I don’t think about being an MLS ambassador. I came to play, and I made the right decision to come and play in Miami. I’m happy and I’m looking forward to it, to continue enjoying it.”
FC Barcelonawanted to sign Messi but could not guarantee that his contract would be registered. Messi ultimately did not want to experience what happened a few years back, when Barcelona promised him he would be registered only to say, towards the end of the off-season, that he would have to find employment elsewhere.
He signed for Paris Saint-Germain next, which became a tumultuous affair. He struggled to adapt and with injuries and COVID in his first season. In his second, he delivered strongly and won the FIFA World Cup for Argentina.
However, he made a decision to leave the Parisian club, and with time his relationship with PSG and its ultras deteriorated.
He says his adaptation to his new club has gone much better this time around.
“The departure to Paris was difficult because of how it happened. I wanted to stay in Barcelona, but it happened from one day to the next. I had to adapt very quickly, to a different environment from what I knew. But now everything is different. We, along with my family, chose where we wanted to go and we are very happy with our choice,” Messi said.

These are just a few of the emotions I didn't experience today when I read that Jose Mourinho ruled out the signing of Lionel Messi yesterday. Speaking at length about La Liga and pretty much everything else that would grab the headlines with BT Sport, the Chelsea manager categorically denied that his club are in a position to capitalise onLionel Messi'sreported ""unhappiness"" in Catalunya. Obviously.
The reason? First off, Mourinho went down the Financial Fair Play route, stating that his club has to""follow certain rules, certain numbers, and we obviously have no conditions to buy. In this moment we cannot do"", before adding, rather intelligently I might add, that""I don’t think they want to sell"".
It's refreshing to hear Mourinho talk so candidly about this situation given his history with FCBarcelona; indeed a cynic might have suggested that Jose would have taken this opportunity to ""stir the pot"" and create some trouble over in the Catalan capital, but he didn't. Instead, he just told the truth and helped put an end to an entirely false transfer rumour.
Jose Mourinho and...logic? This might take some getting used to...

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2014/11/24/7274591/will-we-ever-see-another-lionel-messi,Will We Ever See Another Lionel Messi?,185.199.228.220,"Nov 24, 2014","Head Coach Luis Enrique was quick to say that he believes Messi is unique, an argument that takes little persuading, but will we see another player born with such talent mixed with the perfect club for his abilities?
The Messi story is one that combines great talent with a lot of luck. It was Carles Rexach who was the firstBarcelonaofficial to see the future four time World Player of the Year live, Messi had relatives living in Western Catalonia who helped persuade Rexach to give Messi a trial. The infamous napkin contract ensued and Messi has become part of football history ever since.
But say for instance, Rexach wasn't overly impressed with Messi, bearing in mind this was a time when it would take a lot of commitment and money to fly a 13 year old Argentine halfway across the world, Messi would likely still be living in his home country having not received the proper treatment for his growth-hormone deficiency.
For a player to reach the heights of Messi, there has to be a number of factors he has to meet. First of all he must have an enormous amount of talent. Messi is arguably the most naturally talented players to ever play the game and this is why he has excelled. his ability to control the ball, his ability to score from any angle, his ability to pick out a pass are all aspects that come natural to him.
Many other players do share similar talents in certain departments. For example Sergio Agüero has the ability to score from anywhere, Xavi can pick out a pass and Andrés Iniesta has one of the best first touches you will ever see but no player has all of these attributes combined.Cristiano Ronaldois the closest current player to Messi in terms of talent but the majority of Ronaldo's skills have come through hard work and practice whereas Messi's seem more natural.
Another important aspect is the training they receive as a child. While nowadays the scouting system has exploded and practically every top club is searching every corner of the earth for the next Messi, is it at all possible to see a marriage made in heaven at such a young age again? The most likely answer is no.
Young players are forever being lured away from home at a young age by the promise of a big future but the reality is these kids don't receive the kind of training they need to make it, regardless of how big their talent is. Barcelona is truly unique at educating young footballers and making them into well rounded men as well as world class footballers.
That's not to say La Masia doesn't have it's weaknesses. The academy does have the ability to lose great players to other clubs offering a place in the first team, take for example Cesc Fàbregas. He left La Masia to join Arsenal where he was ensured of a starting spot within a few years, something that he would've taken a lot longer had he stayed at Barça. Fàbregas eventually rejoined but there was an argument that he had lost some of his La Masia training and never really integrated properly back into the side.
This just highlights how lucky it was for Messi to stay at La Masia and also how essential it was. There have been reports recently that Arsenal tried to sign Messi at the same time as Fàbregas, in which case you have to wonder would Messi be as good as he is now if he had left Barça? There's no doubt he would still be a great player but the kind of coaching and surroundings at Barça helped to excel him to another level.
The third criteria is the player's attitude. You speak with teammates of Messi and they all describe of his incredible hunger to win and help the team. You could be forgiven for thinking that after a trophy-laden career, Messi may have lost that little desire to win but Jeremy Mathieu expelled those myths earlier this month. ""...he is hungry for titles again after Barcelona didn't win anything last year. Messi has the desire to win titles again and to be the best player in the world once more. He is out for revenge.""
A incredible love for the sport and desire to win are what sets the best players apart from the great players. Pep Guardiola spoke of his obsession with the game and how he believed carrying a football with him every where he goes would give him an extra edge over other players. This obsession is a vital part to becoming the best player in the world.
The thing is, a player can match all of this criteria, have the best training in the world mixed with the best talent and you can convince yourself that it is possible to find another Messi. But then you watch Messi and you realise, no one will ever be this good again in our lifetimes.
So take ten minutes out of your busy day, sit back and enjoythe brilliance of Lionel Messi.

Granted, league leadersReal Madridcontinue to hold a game in hand over their eternal rivals, but it was the style of the win that was most encouraging for Culés; although delve deeper and statistically, it was also a significant win. Why? Well, it represented the eighth successive win that FC Barcelona have claimed when fielding Luis Suarez,Lionel Messiand Neymar in the same line-up.
While the triumvirate got off to a rocky start to life together with a 1-3 El Clasico defeat againstCarlo Ancelottiand Real Madrid followed by a disappointing home defeat againstCelta Vigo, they have been impressive ever since, improving with each and every game they play together.
And just look at the quality of opposition that they have been beating: Ajax,Sevilla,Valencia,Espanyol, Paris Saint-Germain, Elche, Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna; that’s five top quality teams, one local rival and only two that you might classify to be ""bottom feeders"". Messi, Suarez and Neymar have been sensational, bullying opposing defenses and generally wreaking the kind of havoc we expected them to when the Suarez signing became official.
Out of the total 28 goals scored across the eight matches, Messi, Suarez and Neymar have accounted for 22 – that’s nearly 80%, and despite the quality of the teams we have faced, we’ve conceded just four in those matches. I guess it just goes to show that sometimes, the best form of defense really is a strong attack.

A very cool story waspublished by Diario Sportthis week in which it describes the struggles thatLionel Messihas with picking up his son Thiago from school. According to the article, which cites an Argentine journalist who has been following Lionel lately, Thiago loves his school and friends so much that he starts to cry and complain as soon as Daddy Leo comes to bring him home at 1PM. It looks like Leo has had trouble with that for a while, but then he found a solution – bring his striking partner together.

The story has some nicepicturesthat show Leo and Luisito together at the school,and this photoshows what appears to be a very happy little Thiago on his dad’s arms – not because of the dad, but because of the dad’s friend, who also happens to have his kids studying at the same school and comes at the same time to pick up his own children.

""And it looks as if the results are paying off, becausethose who witnessed the scene inform us that Thiago was very happy and pleased when his father came to pick him up along with his strike partner,"" the article continues.

There’s a lot of cool things to see here. First of all, Suárez and Messi have become good friends off the pitch, which invariably and undoubtedly has a good impactonthe pitch. Second, Thiago Messi is just the cutest little thing ever. Good genes, obviously.
Third, even the great Lionel Messi is a Daddy Dork.

Last year's award was won byAndrés Iniestaafter his Euro 2012 heroics which saw Spain lift the trophy. But this year Iniesta didn't make the top 10 which left the door open for Messi to win for the second time or Ronaldo or Ribéry to win their first.
There is no doubt Lionel Messi had another great season, scoring 46 league goals and guidingBarcelonato the La Liga title, while also adding another Ballon d'Or to the collection. He set the pace in the race for the Pichichi in the early stages of the season and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, surpassing Gerd Muller as he scored 86 goals in 2012.
The end of the season was a little less extraordinary as Messi picked up an injury which effectively ruled him out of the rest of the season. The Argentine's mood reflected that of Barcelona as the club was knocked of the Champions League and the Copa del Rey by Bayern Munich andReal Madridrespectively.
Which brings us ontoCristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese winger also had another impressive season at Los Blancos, scoring 34 league goals in 30 appearances and assisting 10 times. Most impressively Ronaldo managed to steer relatively clear of the impending implosion caused by José Mourinho's public feud withIker Casillasand Sergio Ramos. Ronaldo also had a healthy contribution in the Champions League, scoring 12 goals in 12 games, the highest goal tally in that year's competition, and perhaps had some of his teammates reached his heights, Madrid would've challenged Barcelona for the La Liga title.
Internationally, Ronaldo continued his Madrid form for his country Portugal and passed the 100 cap mark, helping Portugal to the top of theirWorld Cupqualifying group in the process. Having spent many award ceremonies coming up second best, Ronaldo will be hoping that for once it will be his name inside that golden envelope.
In terms of club trophies, Franck Ribéry trumps Messi and Ronaldo having won the treble with Bayern this season. The first major trophy of the season was the Bundesliga as Bayern confirmed themselves as champions in record time with six games to spare. Next was the Champions League final against German opponents Borussia Dortmund and Bayern triumphed their too, with a lateArjen Robbenwinner in the 89th minute sealing a 2-1 victory. The treble was completed in June as Bayern overcame Stuttgart to win the German Cup final in Berlin.
This trophy-laden season will be Ribéry's biggest influence when it comes to deciding the winner, something the player himselfwas very keen to point out. But as the player says, Messi and Ronaldo have both scored more goals then Ribéry and in an individual award that may tip the scale back in the La Liga players' favour.
To end this article, I thought I'd share with you what I believe to be each player's best goal of the 2012-13 season, enjoy!

Messi was buzzing around the net and in the 72nd minute the Argentine put Zarra in his rear-view mirror, scoring goal number 252 by tapping the ball into the back of the net.

It wasn't one of Messi's prettiest goals in his career, heck, it wasn't even his prettiest goal of the game, but it is a goal that will be eternally remembered as the goal that broke a record that stood for almost 60 years. And Messi's teammates agreed that it was a goal for the ages.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2017/1/15/14277906/messi-contract-renewal,Messi Renewal a Priority,185.199.231.45,"Jan 15, 2017","The contract renewal ofLionel Messihas been the subject of much debate in recent weeks. Pressure is growing on the board from both the squad and outside sources to begin negotiating an improved deal for the Barça number 10.
“With Messi what you have to do is give him a new contract, not have common sense,” - Luis Suárez
Messi’s teammate Luis Suárez urgedBarcelona’s board to offer a new contract and it is most likely a mutual feeling from within the dressing room. The 29 year old Messi still has 18 months to run on his current deal which he signed in 2014 but the increase of pressure on the renewal has come from the influx of players to China. The money being pumped into the league has allowed Chinese clubs to spend astronomical figures on average to good players. Therefore it is right to assume a player of Messi’s quality would be offered an obscene amount of money. Messi has many times stated he wants to stay at Barça in the past but when eye-watering amounts of money are on the table, it is understandable to think his head may be turned.
It is not only Chinese investors that have got the Barça board worried. It is no secret that under Pep Guardiola, Manchester City have enquired about the availability of Messi and the prospect of reuniting with the coach that had the biggest impact on his career would be an interesting opportunity for the Argentine. City also don’t represent the sole club interested in acquiring Messi and you can imagine there would be a long line of teams willing to break the bank in order to purchase him.
The Barcelona board have said that it is a case of finances and they can’t afford to shell out huge figures just because other clubs are offering that amount. The CEO stated that it was because of La Liga’s spending caps that negotiations weren’t going as smoothly as planned. Club President Josep Maria Bartomeu ensured fans that the club were doing everything they can and that will do ""everything needed” to keep hold of him.They said they needed common sense but surely common sense is to keep Messi whatever the cost?
When the player has picked up an injury we have seen glimpses of a Barcelona without Messi and there is a significant drop in quality. The old phrase of no player is bigger than the team still rings true for many clubs but it can be argued that Messi breaks this mould. He is the face of Barcelona both in a playing sense and a marketing sense.
The situation is quickly divulging into the players against the board and the heads of Barça will need to act quickly to stop it in its tracks. So while the team continue to battle for trophies on the pitch, one of the most important battles occurs off it.

“I watch almost all Barça games, I am a fan of the club. I have great admiration for the players who play there and I hope to be there too.”
The teenager also spoke about the comparisons to Lionel Messi and admits the GOAT has had a huge impact on his playing style.
“Yes, it was always him, he is a player I am inspired by, I watch videos of him daily. He is a teacher. I do not have words to describe,” he added.
“Everything he does is phenomenal. How to explain in words that everything he does is phenomenal, I always try to reproduce what he does on the pitch.”
And there were also a few words about Barcelona-bound Vitor Roque who he already knows very well.
“I was very happy when I found out I was going there. He is a boy with whom I get along very well, we are friends,” he explained.
“We have already played together. I was very happy for him. Who knows if one day we will get to play together at Barcelona.”

If you delve deep enough, there are always hidden gems to be found, particularly when it comes to sports. Whether it's ""agents"" proclaiming the next big transfer, ""club insiders"" bringing the latest dressing room gossip, or in this case, an unknown source with an ""exclusive"" report detailing the alleged winner of the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or.
Spoiler: it isn'tCristiano Ronaldo.
According to the mysterious@AgenciaNews,Lionel Messiwill allegedly walk away with his fifth Ballon d'Or, leaving Cristiano Ronaldo andFranck Riberytrailing in his wake, with Andres Iniesta and formerBarcelonastriker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic occupying fourth and fifth place -- and usually, speculation and rumours like this would be discarded without much thought.
However, the Twitter handle in question has previous; they were amongst the first to report that FIFA had extended the voting deadline just a couple of weeks ago and somehow escaped the headlines last year, despite correctly predicting the rankings of the top five in the 2012 Ballon d'Or -- roughly a month before the results were officially announced. The same account tweeted an exclusive regarding Eric Abidal's move to Monte Carlo approximately 48 hours before AS Monaco confirmed the signing, and continuing on the Ballon d'Or theme, they also correctly reported the ranking of four of the top five managers in the 2012 FIFA World Coach of the Year Award.
Let's take it with a pinch of salt; Lionel Messi will surely remain an outsider for this year's award, but maybe success isn't out of his reach after all...

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2014/11/25/7224839/lionel-messi-fifa-ballon-dor-decline-analysis,On Lionel Messi,45.155.68.129,"Nov 25, 2014","Another game, another broken record; with his hat-trick at the weekend againstSevillaFC,Lionel Messietched his name into the record books for the umpteenth time, claiming one of his most historic achievements to date – a place all alone at the top of theall-time La Liga goalscoring chart. For nearly 60 years, Zarra’s record had stood unbroken, unchallenged. From Ferenc Puskas to Alfredo di Stefano. From Raul to Hugo Sánchez. Many had tried, but until now, no-one had even got close.
The consensus in Spain used to be that this record was unbreakable – what some might consider a historical anomaly: the equivalent of Wilt Chamberlain’s 100 point game in the NBA or Joe DiMaggio’s 56 game hitting streak in MLB; a by-product of a different, bygone era. But every now and again, an individual with the talent to transcend the ages will grace a sport: an individual like Lionel Messi.
Ever since he burst onto the scene in the autumn of 2004, it was evident that we were witnessing something special. The speed, the technique and even at such a tender age, his predatory instinct and precociousness in front of goal; Messi had all the attributes to succeed at the very highest level and an attitude to match. Hard-working, humble, reserved; this was just an ordinary kid with extraordinary ability.
Talent in its purest form.
His rise, whilst inevitable, was meteoric. At just 21 years of age, Messi was the undisputed leader for club and country; he had arrived, or so we thought – yet the reality was that this was just the beginning.
Year on year, season on season; Messi continued to improve. He scored more goals, made more assists and won more titles, both individually and as part of Pep Guardiola’s collective at FC Barcelona. Transitioning from his peripheral role on the wing, Messi transformed the modern game with his interpretation of the conventional centre-forward position, introducing the phrase ""false nine"" into the footballing lexicon.
And still, year on year, season on season, Lionel Messi continued to find ways to improve. He scoredmoregoals, mademoreassists and wonmoretitles – taking his game one step further to reserve himself a space at the head of the table in the pantheon of all-time greats.
Pele, Diego Maradona, Alfredo di Stefano; even the greatest could only dream of scaling the individual heights that Messi attained in 2011/12. 72 goals in a single season,91 across the calendar year of 2012; this was the absolute pinnacle, not just of that season, but ofanyseason.
And therein truly lies Messi’s brilliance; having scored 72 goals in a single campaign, and having scored 91 in a calendar year, we almost expected another improvement in the following season. An athlete hits not just his absolute peak, buttheabsolute peak – and yet we almost expected something more.
Whether we had desensitised to Messi’s brilliance, or whether he had normalised the impossible was irrelevant – the fact was, at his very best, Messi’s talent seemed limitless, beyond the realms of anything we had ever seen before. He made us question the boundaries of what was, and wasn’t possible in our sport, and for that, more so than Diego Maradona or Pele, Messi deserves to be crowned the greatest footballer of all-time.
That expectation of something more, of yet another impossible improvement never quite materialised. Year on year, season on season, Lionel Messi declined. He was scoring fewer goals, and at times, providing fewer assists as well. He losthis individual titles, coinciding with the relative downfall of Pep Guardiola’s FC Barcelona and the subsequent spells that the club have spent in title purgatory under the guidance of the late, greatTito Vilanova, Gerardo Martino and now underLuis Enrique.
Naturally, without the titles to show for his individual excellence, Messi’s form is coming under greater scrutiny than ever before.
Messidependencia, o Messi en declive?
The narrative had changed entirely; and whether you label it as a decline or as something else, the statistics were irrefutable – Messi just isn’t as ""decisive"" as he once was.
Yet, to label his comparative downfall as a decline would be to miss the point; this is more of a regression, both statistically and literally. His goal contribution % is falling, his shot contribution % is also falling, yes from its peak, but back to the mean – back to a level last seen in the pomp of the Guardiola era.
Key
Each bucket contains a 38 game span of la Liga games. So, bucket 1 includes games 1-38 that Messi was available for. Bucket 2 is games 2 to 39 and so on and forth.
Goal Contribution%= goals scored + assists/Barcelonagoals scored when Messi was on the field of play
Shot Contribution%= shots + key passes/ Barcelona shots when Messi was on the field of play

However, rather than mark a return to those glory days, Messi’s statistical regression has only served to accentuate Barcelona’scurrent problems. His individual brilliance waning, Barça have often struggled and in turn, are no longer the all-conquering side they once were, a fact acknowledged by fans, pundits and even bookmakers.

With Messi’s mortality a key factor, Barcelona entered this season’s first Clasico as rank outsiders and while Culés retained a sense of optimism, it was ultimately unfounded. Messi was quiet and the bookmakers were proven right as Los Blancos emerged3-1 victors– a trend that looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. Indeed,best UK free betsoffer punters a vast array of the latest bookmakers’ promotions on all matches but not even the most ardent Barcelona supporter would back their side at present. The tide is withReal Madrid, withCristiano Ronaldo, and at present it’s they, not FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, who represent the wise investment.

Reactively, Messi, Barcelona and Argentina have planned their response. Leo’s position is changing once again. Like a supernova, the role of the false nine burned bright, but it’s lifespan was ultimately very limited; in the face of a changing tactical dynamic as prompted by the Diego Simeone’s andCarlo Ancelotti’s of the world, Messi is slowly moving from the spotlight and back into the periphery.

A role back on the right-wing appears to beckon and early signs suggest that this could prove beneficial for the player and for his team. Whether he’s positioned as a false nine or as a winger, Messi remains as central as ever, yet with the arrival of Luis Suarez and the rise and rise of Brazilian superstar, Neymar, Messi has been liberated.

The burden has been lifted, and Messi is reaping the rewards. A hat-trick against Sevilla might just be the beginning as our little magician seeks to spearhead the Blaugrana’s latest title challenge. Having fallen agonisingly short in Brazil just a few months ago, Messi must turn to the domestic scene to satisfy his hunger for success, and after claiming the FIFA Golden Ball for his performances in the World Cup, Messi is an outside bet for the FIFA Ballon d’Or, an unprecedented fifth Ballon d’Or, set to be crowned in Zurich this January.

Decline, regression. New role, old role. All these small distinctions are being made yet one constant remains – Messi’s ability to break records and make the headlines: is the fifth Ballon d’Or simply the next on the list?

Of course, no-one really expected Messi to miss a minute of tonight's crucial fixture - but it's a relief that our Argentine superstar has finally been given clearance by the medical team. Thanks to the hamstring injury that Messi picked up in the first-leg of Barca's quarter-final clash with Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona have been without their star striker for all but 29 minutes of their past four matches.
As a result of his injury, Lionel Messi has also fallen three goals behindCristiano Ronaldoas he bids to become the first-ever player to be named as top-scorer of the competition for a record fifth successive time - as if he needs any more motivation to put in an incredible performance tonight - and ominously for Bayern, the last time Messi squared up against German opposition, he scored a stunning five goals against Bayer Leverkusen.

Apart from his incredible vision, excellent reading of the game, creativity and mental speed to perfectly coordinate his leg-eye movements, La Pulga has become an absolute specialist when it comes to free-kicks.
Whenever a foul is given outside the box, and the Argentina international steps up to take it, the world stops to witness him bend the ball over, under or in between the wall with such elegance until it finds the back of the net. And based on his free-kick stats, it makes sense why everyone believes free-kicks are just a synonym to goals when it comes to Messi.
In the last eight seasons in Europe’s five major top divisions:
29 Lionel Messi
27 Juventus
23Real Madrid
21 Roma
21 Lyon
20 PSG
The creative playmaker is not compared to other players, but rather to collective units, teams, because he is just that good. Some more stats to blow your mind: Messi is the first player to score a hat-trick of set pieces since... Lionel Messi’s performance againstEspanyolon 5 May 2012 (two penalties and one free-kick). He dominates the world of free-kicks, in factBarcelona’s number 10 leads in terms of percentage success in LaLiga in the last 25 years:
33 Messi (9.51%)
19 Cristiano Ronaldo (6.13%)
16 Roberto Carlos (4.19%)
15 Ronaldinho (7.32%)
The most outrageous of all of this, is the fact that Messi is not just an expert at free-kicks, but an expert in all aspects of the game. A living football legend that the world has the honor of enjoying every single weekend.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_B1qRG1FAR0ygxyAeGyJdxtWRCg=/0x0:2667x4000/320x213/filters:focal(1090x974:1516x1400)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65690517/1186880406.jpg.0.jpg

While Barcelona fans hope there is no such thing as a post-Barcelona Lionel Messi, there always remains hope for other clubs around the world as long as he’s playing.
In reality, most think Messi will return to Argentina if he is to play for any club other than Barcelona at all. Getting to play a few years at his boyhood club would be a pretty wonderful storybook ending for one of the greatest players of all time.
If there are any other options for Messi other than retiring a Barcelona player or returning to Argentina to play, the only somewhat feasible option was Messi heading to MLS to play out a couple of seasons.
That reality was given a little hint of life when Messi made a video congratulating David Beckham on his new Miami MLS club in a recent video.
“Hi David, first of all congratulations, I hope all goes well with the new project, in this new step you are taking and who knows, in a few years maybe you will give me a call,”

At only 24, Lionel Messi has just completed his brace against Granada, thus surpassing the late, great Cesar Rodriguez to become FC Barcelona’s all-time top scorer in competitive fixtures. Simply put, the man is beyond description. I mean 233 goals in just seven full seasons with the club? Whether or not he is the best player of all-time is irrelevant at this stage: we know for certain this man is the finest to have ever donned the famous Blaugrana jersey.
His first goal was superb, with Isaac Cuenca supplying La Pulga with a sublime delivery to the back-post and the Argentine caught the ball sweetly with a left-footed volley that hit the far post before finding the back of the net. That volley equalled Cesar’s record, and also drew Messi level with Cristiano Ronaldo in the race for the Pichichi, with Ronaldo set to start against Villarreal tomorrow evening.
But the second was even better. Granada had pulled it back to 2-2, but Lionel Messi was not going to let the title fall out of reach just yet. His run was impeccably timed, and he was picked out wonderfully by Dani Alves. Faced with Julio Cesar to beat, how would Lionel Messi break Cesar’s record? Well, just like his very first goal, his 233rdwas a trademark chip.
All I need to say is enjoy him while you can.

Here's the official statement:
Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles (Spanish Liga regulations).
As a result of this situation, Messi shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona. Both parties deeply regret that the wishes of the player and the club will ultimately not be fulfilled.

And so one wouldn't think this was just a case of a lucky start Messi followed that up with nine goals, including a hat-trick, and five assists over the next seven matches. That seven game stretch was ended by a rare La Liga occurrence for Messi, againstCelta Vigo- a game without a goal or an assist, something that happened only once more in the entire league campaign, in Messi's last La Liga game of the season.
After the game against Celta Messi went on a historic run, scoring at least one goal in 19 consecutive league games. That streak was stopped by a hamstring injury that kept Messi out of three La Liga games and limited him in the Champions League quarter-finals against Paris Saint-Germain and the semi-finals against Bayern Munich.
And because of the injury that basically forced Messi out of both Bayern legs a phenomenon namedMessidependenciawas formed. Real or not the naked truth is thatBarcelonaare an infinitely better team when Messi is on the pitch.
Messi returned to La Liga action against Athletic Bilbao as a substitute promptly scoring a goal, something he did again the next week againstReal Betis, extending his league scoring run to 21-games. That run was finally ended the next game against Atletico Madrid, a game Messi started, but re-injured his hamstring forcing him to be substituted off. Speculations began if this marked the end of Messi's season, and even though such announcement was never officially made that was indeed the case.
Throughout the season it appeared that every week Messi broke some kind of record. On 9 December he broke two major records, Cesar Rodríguez's record for most league goals for Barcelona and Gerd Müller's record of 85 goals scored in a calendar year. In January Messi became the first player ever to win four Ballon d'Or awards. Messi also equaled the record of El Clasico goals scored, held by his countryman Alfredo Di Stefano.
For Argentina Messi only featured in four games this season, but despite a low number of appearances he still managed to find the back of then net four times and also assisted on another two.
Moment of the season:With a season like Messi just had how can one pick a single moment of the season? I mean, he scored at least two goals in 20 (!) games. Arguably Messi's best games came against Deportivo La Coruña in October, RealZaragozain November,Osasunain January, and versus AC Milan andRayo Vallecanoin March. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. But in the end the moment of the season is awarded for Messi's performance against Osasuna, the only game in which Messi scored four goals this season.

2013-14 Outlook:This is difficult season to predict for Messi because of the arrival of Neymar. But not because I don't think they won't be compatible with each other, but because two things can happen: Neymar will take over some of Messi's production or Messi's output will be even greater because defenses will have somebody else to worry about. Either way it figures to be a productive season forLa Pulgaand there is a definite possibility that even more records will be broken.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2015/7/22/9011411/lionel-messi-the-king-of-european-fantasy-football,Lionel Messi - King of European Fantasy Football,45.155.68.129,"Jul 22, 2015","After winning numerous flashy accolades for the past season, it is probably a bit less known fact thatLionel Messialso stands as statistically the best player in Europe - thanks to Big Data which drives daily fantasy sports.
Daily fantasy sports (DFS) is a relatively new phenomenon. Some say it's definitely a game of skill, others claim it's just another form of gambling and shouldn't be legal.
DFS, ''the next big thing'' is taking North America by storm and slowly knocking on Europe's doors. The way it works is simple: sports lovers select a team of real world athletes who then score fantasy points according to set scoring rules.

Presently, in most US states, fantasy sports (including DFS) is generally considered a game of skill and therefore not legally considered as gambling (where there's an element of both luck and chance). However, there are a few states that have either a more restrictive set of laws that outline what is considered a game of skill or have specific laws outlawing paid fantasy sports. These states are currently Arizona, Montana, Louisiana, Iowa and Washington. According toLegal Sports Report, gaming regulators in Nevada are thinking about taking a look at the legal frame of DFS. The state ''could emerge as a pivotal state in the American conversation over the legality of real-money daily fantasy sports contests''.



At a US federal level, fantasy sports is defined and exempted by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA). The act, signed into law byGeorge W. Bush, included an explicit provision noting that the law would not apply to fantasy sports games, educational games, or any online contest that ""has an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants, or their skill at physical reaction or physical manipulation (but not chance), and, in the case of a fantasy or simulation sports game, has an outcome that is determined predominantly by accumulated statistical results of sporting events, including any single score, point-spread, team performance, or individual performance in such sporting events...""
Talking about the legal issues of DFS in Europe is not easy as each country has a different vision of what iGaming/moneytainment is, as well as what a skill and luck game is. Most countries allowing fantasy sports have already included fantasy sports in their traditional iGaming licences. The most obvious example is the UK, where DFS falls in the same category as sports betting and horse racing. Therefore, the operators need to acquire an operating ''pool betting'' licence from theGambling Commission.
Some countries are not aware of DFS yet, and their legislator has therefore no opinion on that subject for the moment. In France, the iGaming regulator ARJEL (Autorité de régulation des jeux en ligne) is not offering (yet) a specific legal frame of fantasy sports yet.
In many countries, for instance in Germany, the regulation of gaming is based on whether the predominance for the outcome of the game lies in skill or chance. While this distinction is simple for pure games of chance and pure games of skill, it is a complex and yet unsettled question. Is relative skill or the chance dominating the outcome of a game? Is DFS more similar to chess, which is legally classified as a game of skill - i.e. not gambling, or to roulette, which is regarded as a pure game of chance?

According toIngo C. Fiedler, a researcher at the University of Hamburg who has a deep understanding of gambling, DFS falls into the category of mixed games. ''Whether it is considered a game of skill or chance depends on the question at hand. For example, there is a distinction between a game being recognized as a game of skill/chance in the legal/regulatory sense and other senses, e.g. for income tax purposes. From a legal perspective, it is essential if the majority of the players are playing it as a game of skill or as a game of chance. In this regard, I think of fantasy sports as a game of chance.'' For other purposes, e.g. if a professional fantasy sports bettor is due to income tax, the game is to be deemed a skill game, because this individual player plays it as a game of skill.
The reason for this distinction is the repetitions: the more often a mixed game is repeated, the higher the share of skill that is involved. Fiedler says that some fantasy sports bettors do not play it often enough to play a game of dominant skill. ''However, a few heavy highly involved players (like the professional bettors), play it often enough to reach the so called Critical Repetition Frequency (CRF), which is the threshold of repetitions a mixed game has to be played until skill dominates the outcome.'' At the same point he stresses that empirical evidence is yet to be presented on where the CRF lies for fantasy sports as it was originally applied to poker.
For Valery Bollier, CEO of the most advanced European fantasy football/soccer gameOulala.com, it is very important to differentiate a skill game from a luck game because the whole point of DFS is to prove to your friends that you know sports better than them: ''The results have to be as close as possible to reality. If you have an encyclopaedic knowledge of football, you should reasonably expect to beat your friends who only have a social interest in football. Therefore, if the result of the game is random, your friends might crush you, which is purely unacceptable.'' In other words, what's the point of playing the game if luck determinates the winner?
So, what are the skills that are needed to play DFS? As written on the website ofAmerican Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA), DFS players ''must take into account a myriad of statistics, facts and game theory in order to be competitive''.
Bollier believes that Oulala has everything it takes for a client to become a skilled player - thanks to Big Data: ''The cornerstone of our game is a sophisticated mathematical matrix allowing our game's results to be as close as possible to reality. Our scoring system includes 70 football statistics, and each criteria is weighted based on the player's position (keeper, defender, midfielder, and striker), to stick even more to the reality of a football game.''

In concrete terms, when a football player performs one of the actions on the field, all the virtual teams having selected him will be automatically given points, positive or negative - according to the real on-field performance. Extra bonuses don't exist, since that increases the luck aspect of the game. The effects of events that are hard to predict, such as injuries and substitutions, can be eliminated by a live-coaching feature. All collected data, broken down to different stats, are then available for further analysis, which offers an excellent overview of a player's current form. And the numbers obviously don't lie: FCBarcelonastarLionel Messiwas statistically the best player of the 2014/2015 season with 2330 points, ahead ofReal MadridrivalCristiano Ronaldo(1897pts) and top Chelsea boy Eden Hazard (1435pts). The best goalkeeper was Lyon'sAnthony Lopes(1101pts, 7thoverall), followed by Montpellier'sVitorino Hiltonas the best defender (1066pts, 9thoverall). Gone are the days when we talked only about players' goals.

The best client of their last season's game, who took part in 41 daily competitions, finished among top three ''fantasy managers'' on five occasions. According to a mathematical calculation, the chances of finishing five times on Oulala's podium in a given year if the game was based on luck were 560,000,000 against 1.
Bollier adds that they are currently working with the Maltese government to help create the first skill game licence purely dedicated to Fantasy Sports: ''We believe this is a critical issue in Europe (and a very different situation than in the USA), as some iGaming operators might want to pretend, for marketing reasons, that they offer a game of skill when it is actually a game of luck.''
So far there haven't been any empirical investigations as to whether DFS is really a skill game. Despite the fact that skill in games has to be measured relatively, that is, relative to the skill of other players, in some DFS games - as I have explained in the case ofOulala- luck is certainly present to a certain extent. However, skill plays a greater role in determining the outcome, and this is evident especially at the top of the leaderboard where one can usually find ''fantasy managers'' who do their homework.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9Da525Dw4fZ8mo52dvyhseROwk=/348x197:3091x2026/320x213/filters:focal(348x197:3091x2026)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46797496/GettyImages-476352944.0.jpg

What a difference twelve months has made. A World Cup championship is now under his belt, and with it, a weight has been lifted.
With so many of Europe’s best flocking to Saudi Arabia, Messi went against the grain in joining Inter Miami in the MLS. The worst team in the standings nonetheless. This was a risky move.
But Messi followed his heart, and went to the place where he felt he and his family could be the most happy.
This is a player, who from the beginning, did it for the joy of the game. In many ways, he’s a kid at heart, and the pitch is his sanctuary.
Until it wasn’t.
As fans of Barcelona and La Pulga, it was heartbreaking to see the way in which he left the club. The team was on the decline for years. Messi was still producing magic single-handedly to keep his side afloat and winning, but financial and organizational turmoil made it impossible to enjoy football the way he always had.
Joan Laporta will have a big task in front of him to make things right between Messi and the club. It may be difficult to do as long as he’s the president given the lack of trust between them.
Even more sad are the years he spent at PSG, the only club who was truly in the running for his signature at the time given how sudden it was.
The Parisians never understood or appreciated what Messi still had to offer.
Bringing in Messi was forcing a square peg into a round hole. There was never a clear vision to take advantage of the talent, and at the end of the day, it was always going to be Kylian Mbappe’s team… although not for much longer ironically.
When failure predictably ensued in theChampions League, the GOAT became the scapegoat.
Was it ever truly about winning for Nasser Al-Khelaifi? Or was Messi, like Neymar before him, just a fancy piece of jewelry to show off to the world?
The World Cup in Qatar was the poetic justice that Messi deserved.
He had a coach who was smart enough to keep things simple tactically, and put a team around Messi that could do the work to allow the little genius to shine and carry that great country to glory.
And football became fun again as a weight was lifted and Messi’s spirit was set free.
Maybe we got a glimpse of it a year prior when Argentina took down Brazil in theCopa America.
Something reset in Messi’s mind that he had won everything there was to win in Europe.
It was time to leave the continent and try his ambitions on another side of the world.
It was always going to be Miami, the second city next to Barcelona that makes his family feel at home.
But when the decision was finally made, many of us Messi fans had fear and apprehension.
There was certainly a seismic talent gap between Messi and the rest of the MLS, but would he be put in a position to succeed in a club that has been truly dysfunctional since its start in 2018. It would be nostalgic to see him joined by Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, but would they be let down by a supporting cast incapable of rising to their level?
In just four games, all doubts have subsided, and the party has started in South Beach.
This is the Messi show, and he is a man on a mission, determined to enjoy his football again.
From the moment he checked in against Cruz Azul, he had a big smile on his face, and he looked relaxed. Like a man who felt loved.
Miami may be the perfect city for him. Not just because the language, weather, and Latin culture will remind him of home. But because it’s a city that recognizes and celebrates sporting greatness.
And in the MLS, he has a chance to be a revolutionary, and complete the job that Inter Miami owner David Beckham started when he joined the Galaxy in 2007.
Make the Americans understand, once and for all, what the greatest sport in the world is. If Pele made the introduction with the Cosmos, let Messi be the one who makes them fall in love.
Maybe it won’t be about winning titles, although I’m certain he will. What Messi is doing is far more impactful.
He’s capturing the imagination of a nation, and fans around the world, who are living in a world with fierce competition for their attention.
But that’s the thing about watching Messi play.
Your eyes are glued to the game, waiting for the impossible to manifest.
So far, we’ve seen a motivated Messi who is at the height of his powers.
How did you feel when you saw the game winning free kick against Cruz Azul?
How about when he did it again to rescue his team against FC Dallas?
As a fan, it’s a spiritual feeling I never thought I’d experience again.
A feeling only Messi can produce that transcends football.
You see the magical moment coming from a mile away, and yet it’s an astonishing delight every time.
This is Messi’s world, and I’m happy to be living in it.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mqCvNEUymKGyd7Lf5earjnlHkBY=/0x0:4008x2672/320x213/filters:focal(1684x1016:2324x1656)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72523475/1597734989.0.jpg

Now that the medical services are fully aware of the extent of the injury, sources with knowledge of the situation told Barça Blaugranes that they're real concerned about how bad Messi's foot is. It's notjustan inflammation, and it's not a broken metatarsal. It's somewhere in the middle, which means that the injury could progress or regress, all depending on how much wear and tear Leo puts on it without being truly healed.
It doesn't look that ugly, but it's kind of serious:
Two pictures of Messi's swollen foot, from different news sourcespic.twitter.com/Xlqf6UxVfA

The goal is to get Messi ready for the four-game marathon that includes two matches against Paris Saint-Germain and two La Liga ultra-important games againstSevillaandValencia, that could decide Barça's fate in the Spanish League. The two matches before that 10-day stretch, against Celta Vigo andAlmería, are not that tough and theBlaugranawill survive without their top player.
But after that, Messi isreallyneeded. Barça doctors don't want to rush him from this kind of injury now in fear of damaging him long-term (just ask Kevin Durant). Leo wants to play, but he's not going to if the foot is not 100% better. Let's hope it gets 100% as soon as possible.

Lionel MessiFull Interview With Sky Sports 2012 With English Subtitles - [High Quality] (viaShivDes357)
An interesting interview with Lionel Messi reveals certain charateristics about the player. One of the conclusions is that Messi who is infamously shy, is beginning to change in that aspect. Seems like our favourite player is opening up,finally:)
Maybe, now we can learn more about the world's greatest player. Notice how humble he is? I can't help but find that shocking, after so many years of being the best, arguably the richest and now being hailed as the best ever, how does Messi stay grounded?! You just cant help but like the guy!
Anyway, thought you guys would enjoy this.

At last, we have reached that precious time to sit back, breathe, and focus on the most important thing of all: football. But just when you think you’ve seen and heard it all and the storm looks to have settled in, something hits the Barca universe with an even bigger shock: Lionel Messi’s release clause and his possible exit at the end of the season.
Messi is the only footballer in the world with the power to freely leave his club whenever he feels like it, just like the president of any country can freely decide at any given moment to send troops into battle. Messi has that kind of power and rightfully so after 15 years of magic, elevating the Catalan club to a different level of competitiveness.
The Argentinian captain signed his last renewal deal in 2017, where his release clause leaped from 250 to 700 million euros. And on that same contract, there was a small detail that was never brought to light, which allows the footballer to walk away from the club whenever he wants. This peculiar detail was never confirmed by the club until recently and it has people going into a frenzy with thoughts of Messi packing up his bags and leaving.
How can you believe the man that has it all, and is happiest at Camp Nou is willing to just get up and say goodbye? His commitment to Barca is remarkable and his past 15 years is just an example that proves his loyalty. Messi is not a clause, Messi is football and he bleedsBarcelonaand the Blaugrana colors more than the badge itself.
If you need any more confirmation of the captain’s love for his beloved home, here are some of his words from last year. “I don’t need to change. I am at the best team in the world. I don’t need to change teams or leagues to set new goals. I am at home, at the best club in the world and there is no need to change.” Convincing enough?

The report claims Messi’s four-year contract is worth €555 million and is the biggest deal ever paid to an individual athlete.
Here’s a look at some of the numbers reportedly involved in Messi’s contract which expires at the end of the season.

Barcelona have been quick to respond to the report, denying any involvement in the leak and threatening legal action against the Spanish daily newspaper.
Here’s the club statement in full.
“In view of the information published today in the newspaperEl Mundo,in relation to the professional contract signed betweenFC Barcelonaand the player Lionel Messi, the club regrets its publication given that it is a private document governed by the principle of confidentiality between the parties.
“FC Barcelona categorically denies any responsibility for the publication of this document, and will take appropriate legal action against the newspaperEl Mundo, for any damage that may be caused as a result of this publication.

Messi is also said to be ready to take legal action, according to local reports. The captain’s lawyers are considering filing a lawsuit for making the details of his contract public. The few people at the club who knew the details will also be reported, according toCadena SER.

“We want to build another winning cycle alongside the best player in the world. We all continue to count on Messi.

Reliable reports in Spainare now suggesting that Messi has reached an agreement with Laporta to renew his contract for two more years. As per the same, Barcelona is hoping to finalize the agreement between today or tomorrow, coinciding with Messi’s 34th birthday.
Furthermore, although not 100% confirmed yet, this deal will likely include an option to renew for an additional year — a 2+1 deal. Once his contract is over, he’ll have the opportunity to head over to the United States as a Barça ambassador and play for David Beckham’s Inter Miami. In fact, Messi’s desire to play in the US one day was confirmed by him itself in an interview last December:
Messi told La Sexta: “I’ve always said that I have the illusion of living and playing in the United States, it has always been one of my dreams. But if it will happen or not, I don’t know.”
As far as the finances and economics are concerned, Messi is ready to accept a wage cut. His love for Barcelona is unquestionable and he will always be ready to help the club whenever necessary. La Pulga has never been a player who’ll say “increase my salary and I’ll renew”, he isn’t guided by money.
As always, Messi’s main condition to a new deal at Barcelona has always been the sporting project. Many people who personally know Leo have said that he wants to win trophies, he doesn’t like it when he isn’t challenging for silverware on a collective level. The captain haseven said previouslyhe’s not motivated by money, only playing.
Lionel Messi trusts Joan Laporta and they have an excellent relationship between one another. “Leo knows that whenever I’ve made him a promise, it has been fulfilled. He knows that and has even told me personally, he values it very much”, said Laporta during the election campaign earlier this year.
Lionel Messi signed his first contract with Barcelona on a paper napkin in December 2000. Since then, he has scored 672 goals in 778 appearances and is Barcelona’s all-time leading scorer. Leo’s renewal is no longer a matter of if, but a matter of when.
Barring any last minute surprises, the story between Messi and Barcelona will continue.

According to Rac1, officials from Chelsea FC have contacted Jorge Messi, father of Lionel Messi, to make a formal offer to sign his son. Also according to the report, they have offered to buy out Leo's contract (a €250 million release clause) and raise his wages even more (Messi is already the highest-paid footballer on the planet).
Always according to the report, Chelsea officials wanted to hear from Leo's father what the exact situation is between his son and the club, and especially his relationship with coachLuis Enrique, which according to many reports is not good at all. Rac1 also points out that Messi is good friends with Cesc Fàbregas, who has been campaigning for his friend to come to London and play with him. Cesc has allegedly reached out to Jorge Messi as well, in an effort to convince the dad to convince the son to leave Barça.
The rumors about Messi joining the Blues started again when Leobegan to follow a few Chelsea players on Instagram. Those speculations continue to grow even thoughJosé Mourinho has confirmedthat the club cannot afford to sign Messi right now.

Though I might’ve written an article arguing whyMessi should winfootball’s most prestigious individual prize I feel kind of saddened that La Pulga has won it yet again. Lionel Messi is without a doubt the best player of his generation but in 2010 some others were more deserving recipients’ of this accolade. This year’s ceremony broke the recent trend of awarding the Ballon d’Or to a World Cup winner. In 2006 Fabio Cannavaro won the award for his superhuman displays at the World Cup.

At the 2006 World Cup, Cannavaro was quite simply flawless but so were a couple of his teammates. Even Marco Materazzi had an outstanding tournament. After his 2006 World Cup heroics, the Ballon d’Or recipient went on a dramatic decline.Xavihas been outstanding for the last couple of years; it is him that makes Spain and FC Barcelona tick. With him pulling all the strings in midfield, Spain as well as Barca won everything there is to win in ALL of world football.In a couple of weeks Xavi will be 31, his chances of ever winning the Ballon d’Or have vanished, for good. He has won all there is to win, achieved everything that can be achieved yet he’ll probably end his career without ever having won the individual accolades, he more than any other, deserves. Again, anytime Lionel Messi wins an award it will not be without any merit or justification but in 2010 I just feel that he wasn’t that deserving.However, Lionel Messi will become the first back-to-back winner of the Ballon d’Or of the new millennium. Judging by this years’ award ceremony only a title-less season will prevent him from repeating Michel Platini’s feat of winning the Ballon d’Or three times in a row. The difference between a possible if not likely third Ballon d’Or of La Pulga and Platini’s achievement – until 1995 it was impossible for non-EU foreigners to win the coveted prize.

The point I’m trying to get across is that during the 80’s Platini was in a class all by himself. I wonder if he would’ve won three Ballon d’Or’s if Maradona had been eligible for the award. In any case, Lionel Messi is once again officially crowned the best player in the world. I had an absolute blast watching Cristiano Ronaldo’s face when it was announced that the (male) winner of the FIFA Ballon d’Or player would be broadcasted next, priceless.

Playing alongside Lionel Messi is a double-edged sword. La Pulga will help your team win but there’s absolutely no chance you will shine next to him; while Xavi,Iniestaand company are football superstars, little Lionel just happen to be a Supernova. If Xavi or Iniesta played for any other team they might’ve won the award since it is them who contribute a whole lot to Messi’s individual accomplishments. Nevertheless, a Barca player has once again won the award, that’s all that matters.

First of all, thanks to all those who voted – all 418 of you. It was a great turnout compared to previous polls on the site, and the vast majority of you voted for a worthy winner:Lionel Messiwas clearly the Best Player of the past season, and perhaps of any other season. His record-breaking haul of 73 goals and 29 assists is more than some teams manage in an entire season, although even they fail to tell the whole story. Lionel Messi is far more than a goal-scorer, far more than a team player – he is the hub of the team, a man who excels at everything he sets his mind to.
As the season started, few could comprehend how he could improve upon his 2010/11 totals of 53 goals and 24 assists, yet he did. Some thought that he could score more goals, but his assist tally would have to fall. It did the exact opposite. No matter how high Lionel Messi sets the bar, he still manages to push it closer to the heavens with each passing year, so much so that you would be forgiven for believing that he is indeed a God among men, on the football pitch at least.
DespiteBarcelona""falling"" to a second place finish, Messi found the time to contribute 66 goals, a total that eclipses all other teams in La Liga, barReal Madrid. The Argentine finished the league season with a chance conversion ratio of around 25%, some 7.5% higher thanCristiano Ronaldo, 5% better than Colombian goal-machine Falcao and 4% better than Roberto Soldado,Fernando LlorenteandKarim Benzema. If that wasn’t enough he played over two times as many accurate through balls as his nearest challenger and supplied the second-most assists behind Mesut Ozil.
Messi was also the best player in the UEFA Champions League, scoring the most goals, tying for joint-most assists and also completing the highest number of through balls. While he couldn’t cap off either competition with a winner’s medal, he so very nearly dragged his club to victory, almost devoid of help from anyone else when it mattered most. Dare I mention his vastly improved performances on the international stage too? Let’s just say there is no longer a Messi of Barcelona and a Messi of Argentina; all that remains is a single individual, who at just 25 has accomplished more than virtually any other player in the history of the sport. A single individual who continues to improve as a player; a single individual who might just be the best of all-time.

With countless individual and team accolades under his belt, all at the tender age of 25, he appears destined to create one of the greatest legacies this game has ever seen; and that's in spite of the problems he faced in his youth. Born in Rosario, Argentina to parents, Jorge Messi (who is now Leo's agent) and Celia Cuccittini, Messi was a small child, and in 1998, when he was just 11 years old, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. His local club could not pay for the treatment, and nor could River Plate, but FCBarcelonaoffered to pay the bills after Messi completed a successful trial with the club.
The rest as they say, is history. Messi has grown both literally, and as a player, becoming one of the greatest of all-time and his story has served as motivation for many young children who face similar problems - Messi is an inspiration. And this story has been told countless times, but perhaps the greatest account of Messi's rise to prominence was written by renowned sports journalist, Luca Caioli. The book, ""Messi: The Inside Story Of The Boy Who Became A Legend"" contains interviews with prominent figures in Messi's life (such as his parents and family), and also with some of his colleagues (former coaches at Newell's Old Boys, managers such as Frank Rijkaard and former teammates, such asPablo Zabaletaand Ginaluca Zambrotta). It's a great read, and now, Epic Pictures have acquired the rights to put Messi's story onto the big screen.
With a planned release date coinciding with next summer's 2014 FIFA World Cup, Epic Pictures CEO Patrick Ewald said that ""The goal is to make a powerful and positive film that will leave audiences feeling inspired to go after their dreams no matter how impossible they may seem.""

Lionel Messi gave two assists, but it was not enough as Argentina’s defense crumbled in the second half.
Messi finished the competition with only one goal, a relatively low return for his standards. And one big reason why is he had almost no service:
Lionel Messi received only two passes from teammates inside the penalty area during the whole World Cup.Isolated.pic.twitter.com/lhCdNMKfbd
Messi only received two passes inside the penalty area during the entire tournament, once against Croatia and once against Iceland. The pass against Croatia was one where he received the ball and it was blocked immediately as he tried to redirect it onto the goal.
Messi did drop deep, but it was because Argentina failed to move the ball from the middle of the park into the final third. Éver Banega helped in that regard as he started being picked in the last two matches, but it was not enough.

It was some goal from Messi too, a sumptuous free kick that he floated over the wall and past the goalkeeper who remained rooted to his line.
Perhaps unsurprisingly it was yet another landmark goal for Messi as it means he has now broken Gerd Muller’s record for the most league goals scored for the same club in Europe’s top five divisions.
Muller had managed 365 for Bayern Munich but Messi has now gone past the German legend on 366 goals.

Mino Raiola was the undisputedMoron of the Week, but the Stinker of the Week award definitely goes to this absolutely outlandish rumour:
""A source close to ManUnitedOnly.com has told us that Manchester United will be looking to prise Lionel Messi away from Barcelona next summer with a staggering £80m bid. The figure will be recognised as the same that Real Madrid spent in taking Cristiano Ronaldo from Old Trafford to the Bernabeu.
Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has been told he can spend big during the next summer transfer window, with promises even being made to United striker Wayne Rooney that more talent is on the way.
Manchester United, by the time the summer transfer window opens, will have at least £150m to spend on some of the best players in the World and it seems that Lionel Messi will be the number one target to bring more threat in attack.""

Barcelona have already been contacted by Manchester United concerning Lionel Messi and they were surprisingly receptive to the offer. Barcelona's president, Sandro Rosell, stated that he considers 80 million a very fair offer and that he had no qualms sending Manchester United an autographed shirt of Lionel Messi and some pictures.
The Argentinian himself was flattered by Manchester United's interest and he said that he was more than willing to enclose a few videos of himself playing.
With the three parties (Manchester United, Barcelona and Lionel Messi) in syntony, it seemed like a done deal.
However, some complications have aroused in the past few days. Much to Barcelona's disbelief, what Manchester United wanted was for Messi to take his talents to Old Trafford and play in the English Premier League.
At first, as should be expected, it was thought that Manchester United were merely joking.  Zubizaretta believed (like anyone would believe) that Manchester United were confusing Messi with their former star Cristiano Ronaldo and he gave them Real Madrid's number.
When he finally understood that it was not a prank call, Zubizaretta told the Manchester United representative to give him some time and he'd fax him an answer.
When he finally stopped laughing, he typed the following:""Give us your whole team + 200 million euros and we'll be glad to let Messi play an exhibition match at Old Trafford.""
Barcelona are still waiting for a response for what they consider to be a very reasonable proposition.

As for Messi actually moving, it won't happen and it's insulting to even suggest that his monetary value is as low as that of Cristiano Ronaldo of all players.
Between us, I'm convinced it was a prank call. Everyone knows that Lionelhas commited his future to Italian giants Palermo.

Much like a high-profile incident earlier in the year involvingLuis SuarezandPatrice Evra, Drenthe claims that Lionel Messi constantly referred to him as ""negro"" when the two players faced each other back in 2010.
Barcelonahave defended Lionel Messi as one might expect, with a spokesman for the clubreportedlysaying this in response:
""The player has always shown maximum respect and sportsmanship towards his rivals, something recognised by fellow professionals. We are sure that any accusations to the contrary are well wide of the mark.""
At current, these claims are entirely unsubstantiated, but as with all accusations of racism, they have an impact on public opinion. For example, die-hard Madridista and journalist for AS, Tomas Rincero tweeted on the subject in a manner befitting of a Real Madrid fan as he took Drenthe’s words for gospel, despite the Dutchman stating in the same interview thatGabriel Heinzeand Gonzalo Higuain both referred toMahamadou Diarrain the same way.
While I deplore racism in any form, there are a few things that need to be taken into consideration, the first of which being that these claims are being levelled against Lionel Messi without any proof. Unless Drenthe has some sort of video or audio that we do not know about, the only ""proof"" we have is the words in that interview for Helden. Shaky evidence at best. Secondly, if Drenthe felt so aggrieved by the whole incident, then why on earth has it taken him two years to speak up? That’s over 600 days since the 2-0 win at the Camp Nou, and now he feels ready to voice his discontent about the treatment he allegedly received from Messi?
Thirdly, and it’s a poor excuse to use, but the use of the word ""negro"" is common place in South American and Latin cultures, and as Drenthe mentioned, it was even common between teammates at Real Madrid, until Diarra educated them otherwise.
Personally, I would place large doubts over the validity of his claims because of that huge time gap, but whatever the case, Lionel Messi is innocent until proven guilty.

Messi was able to vote as captain of Argentina and gave three points for Pedri, two for Paris Saint-Germain full-back Nuno Mendes and one for Bellingham, according toDiario Sport.
The GOAT was spotted looking delighted when Pedri was announced as the winner at the Ballon d’Or ceremony and received some words of thanks from the youngster in his speech.
“Thanks to everyone at Barça, all my coaches, all my teammates, especially the captains, who made it all easier - like Lionel Messi, who is here, thank you for all the help you gave me,” he said. “I dedicate this award to my family, who always gave me advice.”
Pedri will show off his Kopa Trophy to the Camp Nou crowd before Saturday’s La Liga match against Real Betis. Barca Femeni captain Alexia Putellas will also present her Women’s Ballon d’Or trophy to the crowd.

In the history of the world, movements that have sprung from a common socio-political cause have a tendency to build a bond among its supporters. A bond so strong that sometimes it becomes too large to control. Football has that effect on many Indians.
Tonight, thousands of miles from the hallowed grounds of Camp Nou, a lone figure stands as the representative of F.CBarcelonaand Argentina. Like everything else, we have an inclination towards tradition and in our minds; Argentina and Brasil are and will always be the favourties.
The language of football, as far as my dad (and many from his generation) is concerned only consists of eight letters- M-A-R-A-D-O-N-A.Diego was welcomed to India, a few years ago, in a manner that was reserved to very few people in our history, namely:

Unlike most sports fanatics, Indians worship their heroes to the point of obsession. We build temples in their honour, literally. When given the chance, we show them the full extent of our adulation with the use of garlands and the Tilak (a traditional mark on the forehead used by Hindus). Suffice it to say, we treat our heroes as demi-gods and anything to do with said person is a matter of life and death.
I believe my father, although he will never admit it, stopped watching the beautiful game when Maradona retired. It was an end of an era that could never be repeated. Diego was the epitome of football and could never be surpassed.
History, however, has a funny way of repeating itself don’t you think? A couple of months before the 2010 World Cup when the fever set in, Argentina’s tribulations became mine. During one of my hysterical rants against Maradona (for not selecting Riquelme), I made the mistake of telling anybody who would care to listen that Diego would be surpassed.
InLionel Messi, the world found its, heir. In the media-shy and introvert Argentine, India found a player worthy of the love which until now was restricted to only Diego Maradona. But La Pulga will be more than just a hero to us. Messi, unlike Maradona and Pele, will grace India at the peak of his powers. Football being in its nascent stages in India will get a huge popularity boost just because of him. The fact that the Argentinian team is with him is great but is to us, the icing on the cake.
Stars like Angel di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain andJavier Mascherano, although respected don’t sell tickets, atleast not in India. Due to some bad marketing and planning, out of a total of 120000 tickets only 80000 have been sold. Yes, Salt Lake stadium with its newly renovated avatar is capable of holding 120000 fans which is more than most stadiums world-wide, even Camp Nou. I assume that the majority of those 80000 fans will be there to watch only Messi.
That the man is Argentine, left-footed and so similar to his idol in playing style will only make it easier for us Indians to prolong that argument that will, henceforth, be everlasting between my generation and my father’s: ""Has it finally happened? Has Diego Maradona been surpassed?
Like many Indians, I believe it is true. Seventy five percent of our population is under the age of 30 and that makes my generation the majority. After the World Cup finals in the summer of 2010, my dad called me and had this to say ""You were right, Messi is the heir to Maradona and in many ways better than him (hinting at the eccentricities that Diego was (in)famous for)"". Since then my dad has started watching football again.
After tonight, I believe football will be reborn in my country. Thanks to one man, Lionel Messi. He will make my country believe once again (about friggin time, if you ask me).
By the way, Argentina 1 – 0 Venezuela.
Now let us pray, ""Dear God, I hope Lionel Messi visits India again. Amen""

Not only that, but he's managed to score 40 goals in just 141 shots, an average of a goal every 3.5 shots. To put that into context, Falcao's average is four shots per goal, whileCristiano Ronaldo'saverage is an utterly ridiculous seven shots per goal.
In spite of that, Messi has also created nine goals for his teammates (in La Liga) - the same number as Mesut Ozil - while he also boasts a higher pass completion rate than Isco,Xabi Alonso, Ozil and many others. Quite simply, Messi is one of a kind, and as if we needed any more proof, the Argentine has scored in a record-breaking seventeen successive La Liga matches. The run started back in November with a brace against RealMallorcaand 16 games, not to mention 25 goals later, the streak is still alive. So, when do you think the streak will end?

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2011/1/3/1910007/ballon-dor-2010-why-lionel-messi-should-win-over-xavi-and-andres,Ballon d'Or 2010: Why Lionel Messi should win over Xavi and Andres Iniesta,188.74.183.10,"Jan  3, 2011","To be nominated for a prestigious award such as the Ballon d’Or is an honor in itself, although this year’s ceremony is a little bit tarnished with the exclusion of Inter Milan’sWesley Sneijder– who had an outstanding 2009/2010 campaign.
Jose Mourinho likes to bemoan the absence of Sneijder from the final three as well as criticizing the inclusion of FC Barcelona’s Andres Iniesta, mostly due to the fact El Illusionista was injured for a prolonged time. Well, in all fairness the ""humiliated"" one may have a point there. But then again, what did Sneijder do that Andres Iniesta didn’t do? Treble – check; scoring important goals – check. Now, what did Iniesta accomplish that Sneijder didn’t? He won the World Cup!

In a perfect world San Andres, the genius that is Xavi andLionel Messiwould all win the much coveted award. But the world isn’t perfect, somebody has to lose.

Based on trophies won, the shoe-in candidate for this year’s FIFA Ballon d’Or (stupid name by the way) is hands down, Xavi Hernandez. Nonetheless, this editorial doesn’t have the title ""Why Xavi should win over Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi"". This article is making a case for La Pulga alias the greatest player in the world (figuratively speaking, he is of rather small stature).

There isn’t any other player in the world that can rival Lionel Messi’s exploits on the pitch. No, not even the Portuguese poster boy for Armani underwear. At 23, he has already won everything on a club as well as on an individual level. In the past two seasons he scored a ridiculous 85 goals in all competitions. If consistency is the benchmark for quality – Messi is rewriting the criteria. Never one to miss an opportunity, he is more often than not scoring more than one goal a game.

In the past one-season or world cup wonders likeMichael OwenorFabio Cannavarohave won the award but failed to replicate their award-winning form. Meanwhile Messi is on course for another record-breaking campaign and if it weren’t for the incompetence of Maradona to maximize the potential of La Pulga as well as the Albiceleste, he’d be the front-runner for the Ballon d’Or.

Messi is receiving his fair share of criticism but for the most part it is unwarranted since the Argentinean Football Federation has yet to install a manager who makes effective use of little Lionel’s sheer unlimited ability. A Bugatti engine is designed to carry a Bugatti not a Daihatsu.

Besides ever since breaking into the Ballon d’Or top three a couple of years ago, Messi has become a mainstay for the top honors which is further evidence to his credentials.

If anyone should win the Ballon d’Or it is Lionel Messi as he is and has been the best player in the world by quite some distance.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2011/9/2/2400476/lionel-messi-a-demi-god,Lionel Messi: A Demi-God.,45.155.68.129,"Sep  2, 2011","
In the history of the world, movements that have sprung from a common socio-political cause have a tendency to build a bond among its supporters. A bond so strong that sometimes it becomes too large to control. Football has that effect on many Indians.
Tonight, thousands of miles from the hallowed grounds of Camp Nou, a lone figure stands as the representative of F.CBarcelonaand Argentina. Like everything else, we have an inclination towards tradition and in our minds; Argentina and Brasil are and will always be the favourties.
The language of football, as far as my dad (and many from his generation) is concerned only consists of eight letters- M-A-R-A-D-O-N-A.Diego was welcomed to India, a few years ago, in a manner that was reserved to very few people in our history, namely:

Unlike most sports fanatics, Indians worship their heroes to the point of obsession. We build temples in their honour, literally. When given the chance, we show them the full extent of our adulation with the use of garlands and the Tilak (a traditional mark on the forehead used by Hindus). Suffice it to say, we treat our heroes as demi-gods and anything to do with said person is a matter of life and death.
I believe my father, although he will never admit it, stopped watching the beautiful game when Maradona retired. It was an end of an era that could never be repeated. Diego was the epitome of football and could never be surpassed.
History, however, has a funny way of repeating itself don’t you think? A couple of months before the 2010 World Cup when the fever set in, Argentina’s tribulations became mine. During one of my hysterical rants against Maradona (for not selecting Riquelme), I made the mistake of telling anybody who would care to listen that Diego would be surpassed.
InLionel Messi, the world found its, heir. In the media-shy and introvert Argentine, India found a player worthy of the love which until now was restricted to only Diego Maradona. But La Pulga will be more than just a hero to us. Messi, unlike Maradona and Pele, will grace India at the peak of his powers. Football being in its nascent stages in India will get a huge popularity boost just because of him. The fact that the Argentinian team is with him is great but is to us, the icing on the cake.
Stars like Angel di Maria, Gonzalo Higuain andJavier Mascherano, although respected don’t sell tickets, atleast not in India. Due to some bad marketing and planning, out of a total of 120000 tickets only 80000 have been sold. Yes, Salt Lake stadium with its newly renovated avatar is capable of holding 120000 fans which is more than most stadiums world-wide, even Camp Nou. I assume that the majority of those 80000 fans will be there to watch only Messi.
That the man is Argentine, left-footed and so similar to his idol in playing style will only make it easier for us Indians to prolong that argument that will, henceforth, be everlasting between my generation and my father’s: ""Has it finally happened? Has Diego Maradona been surpassed?
Like many Indians, I believe it is true. Seventy five percent of our population is under the age of 30 and that makes my generation the majority. After the World Cup finals in the summer of 2010, my dad called me and had this to say ""You were right, Messi is the heir to Maradona and in many ways better than him (hinting at the eccentricities that Diego was (in)famous for)"". Since then my dad has started watching football again.
After tonight, I believe football will be reborn in my country. Thanks to one man, Lionel Messi. He will make my country believe once again (about friggin time, if you ask me).
By the way, Argentina 1 – 0 Venezuela.
Now let us pray, ""Dear God, I hope Lionel Messi visits India again. Amen""

The two were a part of many special matches and moments as a pair.
Given that last summer, Lionel Messi wanted to leave Barcelona, his re-linking with Pep atManchester Cityhas been rumored on and off for the last 6 months. Despite it appearing that Messi will either return to Barcelona or leave for PSG, the rumors haven’t died completely.
Pep’s father, Guardiola Sr, commented on his son’s potential reunification with Messi in an interview this week.
“I have seen Messi play at the age of 12 or 13 for the first time in the mini stadium and I was already amazed at how he played for Barcelona B. He was extraordinary at that level. There are few [players like] Messi. I think Pep would not be displeased to have him at Manchester City.
“My son [and] Messi, he has always had him [Messi] as high as he would like to be, but today he is at Barcelona and “Josep” has “Barca” in his heart and he would never want to hurt Barcelona [by taking Messi away from them],

The unstoppable rumors of Messi leaving Barça for another league have become stronger; now everybody is talking about it. Again.
The latest player to comment on the issue is Javier Pastore, a midfielder for Paris Saint-Germain, one of the teams that's usually linked to buy every single player in the world of football. In an interview to Argentine TV channel TyC Sports, Pastore guaranteed that his bosses are ready to chase after Messi if Leo leaves one day.
""If Barça decides to sell Messi, I can assure you that PSG will go to war and will do their best to try and sign him. Money is not a problem for our owner and he dreams about signing a footballer like Messi every single day. I'm sure he'll try everything"".

This is not a knock on PSG, but they want everybody. It's no surprise that Messi is a dream of them. But Pastore is right: they have the money. Is that enough to convince Messi to leave?

""When I went to the club I imagined playing in the Primera Division, but I do not know what's going to happen in a few years.

Messi then discussed playing at the home of Boca Juniors in the World Cup qualifiers last month, La Bombonera. The game was a 0-0 draw with Peru, but the experience was worth it.
""It was a beautiful experience personally and I think with the national team it was spectacular.

It really started when the UEFA website itself posted, in error, that Messi has won the Champions League three times. From there, it was reposted by many other sites.
The UEFA website has repeatedly said Messi has four Champions League medals, but they said it one time it was three by mistake.
You can find links to UEFA’s website confirming Messi has a 2006 winner’s medalhere,here,here,here,here,here,here, and probably elsewhere, those are just examples.
The official UEFA Champions League Twitter (or, X) account also has multiple examples confirming the fact:here,here,here,here,here,here,here, and probably elsewhere.
The confusion comes from the 2006 title won byFC Barcelona. Messi was a key player and played seven games, including a goal and two assists, as per Transfermarkt. He played 90 minutes in a knockout match against Chelsea, where he was arguably man of the match. However, he was injured thereafter and did not feature anymore. Still, players who take part like this are still awarded medals even if they miss the final through injury.
We can look at it from Messi’s own account. He said he was so angry that he got injured he didn’t celebrate the win with his teammates, but he came to regret that and now appreciates his 2006 medal.
“Even now I feel completely different about my La Liga medal and my Champions League medal [in 2006],”he said.
It makes complete sense, becauseChampions League rulesat the time allowed for 30 medals to be given to the winner (today, 40 medals are given). The Champions League squad size excluding youth teamers, “List A” as it is called, is 25 players. Meaning for sure 25 players would get medals, with the rest left for the club to decide what to do with (give it to youth players, the manager, or someone else.)
Messi was a youth player at the beginning of the season but wore #19 and was a first team regular by the end. As a player who actually started knockout matches, he would obviously receive a medal. He himself has confirmed he has a medal. And finally, UEFA’s website has repeatedly confirmed it.
Hopefully, this clears up any leftover confusion.

As a result of the tear the Argentine will be forced to sit out the next six to eight weeks. The injury is unrelated to the hamstring injury that sidelined Messi for three weeks earlier this season.
Being out of action for nearly two months Messi will certainly miss La Liga games againstGranada,Athletic Bilbao,VillarrealandGetafe, as well as Champions League games against Ajax and Celtic, and Copa del Rey Round of 32 matches against Cartagena.
Looking at the fixtures Messi will miss he certainly could've ""picked"" a worse time to pick up an injury of this length, with only Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal providing a really noteworthy challenge, especially considering a Champions League promotion has already been achieved.
Messi has had terrible luck, or whatever you want to call it, with injuries over that past six months. Hopefully these two months on the mend will allow him to completely heal the right leg that was bothering him before as well as the left leg that is the cause of the latest injury.

It’s another extraordinary achievement by Messi who may not be done quite yet either, as Barcelona still have games to come against Osasuna and Alaves.
The captain’s played every minute so far since the restart and is unlikely to be rested while the title is still mathematically possible.

”If he had the ball less than usual it’s because Argentina didn’t dominate the match as we did against Iceland.

But Messi is Messi, and he never wants to sit out unless he's absolutely incapable of playing. On Thursday training session, he only did a quick jogging around the pitch while the other players had a normal practice. But on Friday, the Argentine was able to practice normally with the team. There's no update on his condition as of right now, but there's a good chance Lio will be fit for the Celta match.
Before today's session, Messi provided an update on his conditionvia Facebook:
Back in Barcelona. The Tour in US was sweet and sour for me. We got 2 wins with a great job from everyone, but I couldn't play because of my swollen foot. It still hurts a bit, but I hope to recover soon so I can help the National team and FC Barcelona.

As if that wasn’t enough, Xavi rounded off the podium for the Ballon D’Or in third place with his partner in crime Andres Iniesta in fourth.
Lionel Messi will rightly grab the headlines for this magnificent achievement; it is hard to believe that he is only 24. This is his fifth successive year on the podium, and a record-equalling third Ballon D’Or. At this point, it seems inconceivable that the Argentine will not go on to set the bar so high it may never be passed, time is on his side, and with his teammates by his side, he has the perfect platform to further improve. After all, he ""only"" received 47% of the vote!
Amongst all the jubilation for Messi and Guardiola, one cannot help but feel aggrieved that Xavi was not at least second. His efforts over the past year have been pivotal to Barcelona’s success, although he is unfortunate to live in the same era as Messi and Ronaldo. TheReal Madridforward may not be to everyone’s liking, but he is a superb player operating at a similar level to Lionel Messi, at least in terms of goal-scoring. He is working on his teamwork, his side is getting better and if Real go on to success in the remainder of the season, he might reclaim the title from Messi in 2013. That is not a thought I wish to entertain at the moment, especially after finding out Pep enjoys a bit of James Blunt...
It is time for Barcelona to celebrate, but it is also time to look forward. They are enjoying this feeling of success, and the level of respect they command is simply unreal, but these awards have to earned on the pitch. Judging by the derby match at the weekend, there is plenty of work to be done away from the Camp Nou, and the next month or so will be the most important of Guardiola’s reign. This is where we learn what this team is made of.

However, he is expected to start against Sevilla at the Camp Nou on Sunday and will fancy his chances of netting, as the Andalusians are one of his favourite opponents.
Messi has played a total of 37 games against Sevilla in his career and has scored 36 goals, that’s a goal every 61 minutes.
In 25 La Liga appearances he has a ridiculous 28 goals, he’s scored two in five Copa del Rey matches, four in the Spanish Super Cup and two in the European Super Cup.
- Lionel Messi scored 36 goals in 37 appearances against Sevilla, at least 7 more than versus any other opponents.His last 5 matches against Sevilla:2019 - ⚽⚽⚽2019 - ⚽2018 - ⚽2018 -2018 - ⚽#BarçaSevilla#Messi
Of those goals he’s bagged three hat-tricks and seven braces. Simply put, Messi just loves taking on Sevilla and very rarely fails to beat them. In those 37 matches he has came out on the winning side 28 times.
He also loves a free-kick against Sevilla:
#Messi& free-kicks vs Sevilla: the perfect love story#BarçaSevilla#ForçaBarçapic.twitter.com/YCmM0030R1
And Sevilla have already felt the force of Messi in 2019. He bagged a hat-trick at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan in February in a 4-2 win. Last season he was on target in a 6-1 mauling in the Copa del Rey quarter-final at the Camp Nou in December and also scored in the 4-2 league victory before going off with a fractured arm.
Julen Lopetegui’s side will know exactly what to expect if Messi does, as expected, lead the team out on Sunday but stopping him is another matter entirely.

Shaun Robertson, via Facebook
It was easy – it was time to go. I wanted to follow in the footsteps of [Frank] Rijkaard,  who was my coach and said great things about Milan. I had other options, but I wanted to play for Milan. As for that stuff about Messi, it’s not true; you shouldn’t always believe what you read. I always tried to be a good influence on him and actually try to do for him what Ronaldo did for me. I felt embraced by Ronaldo and I wanted Leo to have the same. Messi was always very shy, but always a fantastic player. We lived on the same street, so I had a great relationship with him and his family. Even then I knew he was a better player than me.

We’ve all seen the moments captured by photographers in the UEFA Champions League; Messi unwittingly jogs past the latest Mastercard advert, and the moment comes together to ironically provide us with a more succinct insight on Messi than any journalist could aspire to create.

Priceless.

Master.

There are so many split-second Messi moments that have been captured on film over the years, but it’s this photo, the one at the top of this page that might just be my favourite.

This is a photo that demonstrates the importance of sticking to your beliefs, following the gameplan and maintaining total confidence in yourself.

Barcelonawere on the brink this afternoon at the Mestalla, and based the way that the match was unfolding, it seemed like nothing was going to go their way. They had lost Andres Iniesta to injury in the first half, lost the lead early in the second and appeared to lose their way as they approached the final stages of the game.

In this, their worst start to a season in over a decade, few would have been surprised if Barcelona had lost faith. Certainly the majority of Culés watching the match were resigned to the fact that this match was headed for another disappointing ending – but in amidst the negativity and the difficulties that Barcelona faced today, they kept believing. Even as the fourth official signalled for just two minutes of additional time, Barça didn’t panic. They didn’t rush, they didn’t force it; they just carried on playing.

The sequence of play that led to the decisive penalty was vintage Barcelona. Facing a wall of white shirts, Neymar and Messi combined in intricate fashion to scythe their way through theValenciadefense before Aymen Abdennour returned the favour with his ill-timed challenge on Suarez. Every mistake, every missed opportunity that led up to this moment could be forgotten – dependent upon the outcome of the resulting penalty kick.

Step forward Lionel Messi.

Messi may be priceless, and he is the undisputed master, but his footballing omnipotence hasn’t extended to the penalty spot with any great consistency. Cometh the hour however… even up against the greatest penalty saving goalkeeper in the game and even with Diego Alves (on a yellow card) engaging in over-the-top mind games, when the whistle was blown, it all ceased to be relevant.
Lionel Messi transcends statistics, tactics and precedent – and if you’re really lucky, once he’s done teaching you that, he might just blow you a kiss.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISDlxt3Iljs3J2hrOm1_AKtyiH4=/0x45:3836x2602/320x213/filters:focal(0x45:3836x2602)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51463411/GettyImages-617268850.0.jpg

There’s no denying that there’s a stone left unturned in theBarcelonalegend’s storied career. For many pundits a World Cup victory is all that stands in the way of immortality for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, but despite having never lifted the most prestigious of titles in the world of international football the Argentine has shown through his dominance at Barcelona that he still deserves to go down as the best there’s ever been.
Messi’s plethora of titles and personal accolades is one that stands tall above the rest but look beyond these tangibles from such an accomplished career and you see a player whose skillset is almost celestial.
There are few that have produced the kind of quality on the pitch that the diminutive Argentine has. It’s easy to point to his goalscoring feats but Messi’s brilliance isn’t confined to his ability to put the ball in the back of the net. He’s a lot more than just a finisher. Messi’s vision and adaptability are proven aspects of his game, just look at the amount of assists he produces on a regular basis.
Despite all this, the critics still decry his lack of international silverware. This lack of international success is cause for much debate but Messi has gained an unlikely ally in the form of fellow Argentine great, Diego Maradona.
Maradona has been critical of Messi in the past but it seems even he has come to realise that the Blaugrana talisman is otherworldly. In an interview withOmnisport,Maradonawas quick to come to his countryman’s defence when asked about Messi’s lack of success with Argentina, stating that he has nothing left to prove.
“I would advise Messi to keep playing, to enjoy the game,” Maradona said.
“He has to forget about the critics, if he can win or not the World Cup, theChampions Leagueor the Copa del Rey. He has to enjoy the game into the field.”
Maradona’s comments were well received but not all agree with his take on things.
Argentina’s national coach Jorge Sampaoli is another who has given his opinion on his star player’s World Cup dilemma in a book that willshortly be published, saying: “Messi has a revolver put to his head called the World Cup and if he doesn’t win it, he’s shot and killed.”
It’s a comment that has divided many pundits of the world game. There is little doubt in my mind that Lionel Messi is the greatest footballer to ever step foot on the pitch but without international success he will always have his critics.
A World Cup victory would undoubtedly be an everlasting ode to his greatness but by no means is it a prerequisite. World Cup victory or not, Messi is already the GOAT.

Colombia were awesome in their strategy, and all of a sudden they look like contenders. But this is about theAlbiceleste: they just weren’t good at all except from a 25-minute stretch in the second half, and when push came to shove they just hoped that Messi would save them. That’s their biggest problem, and it’ll continue to be their biggest problem as long as Messi plays for them.

The thoughts on the past competition where Argentina lost are interesting. Describing them as “unjust” is a pretty revealing look into how Messi views the last few years of international play. It really shows how big losses stick with amazing athletes.

Barcelona star Lionel Messi was the Man of the Match today as Argentina narrowly beat Portugal 2-1. The best player in the world assisted Di Maria for the 1-0 in the first half and then scored the winning goal at the 90th minute from the penalty spot. Captain Mascherano and Gabriel Milito also started the match and helped Argentina beat a revitalized Portugal side, who had in Nani their stand-out player.New manager Sergio Batista has built his system around Messi and that has been paying dividends, as expected. After scoring against Brazil in November, Messi now had a great match against Portugal and led his team to victory again. He played in the same position he does at Barcelona and the results were fantastic; his assist to Di Maria was quite simply amazing, as the Real Madrid player admitted.
With a new manager and a system in some ways similar to Barcelona's, Lionel Messi seems poised to lead Argentina to the Copa America title in the summer.
This was overall a very successful day for Barcelona players, as Abidal had a solid performance in France's 1-0 win over Brazil and Spain beat Colombia with several Barcelona players. Afellay also had a very good game, helping Holland beat Austria 3-1.
More importantly, no one got injured and Barcelona will face the challenges ahead (Gijon and Arsenal) almost at full strength - only captain Carles Puyol is out and he should be back soon.

XOEL'S THOUGHTS
Let's me just say that the first half was looking like a disaster. Once again, it looked like a typical bipolar Barça, as the team played poor defensively, lacked the finishing touch on offense, and looked lost. But once again, Lionel Messi saved the day with his golazo just before the half.
Espanyol lost a golden chance to make it 2-0 in the first half. Thanks to Claudio Bravo's skill, Barcelona was still alive. This play, along with Messi's curling golazo, changed the game.
In the 10thminute, it looked like a clear foul on Xavi inside the penalty box. But the referee didn't see it like that.

Penalti no pitado a Xavi.http://t.co/rO1uJezf71


I'm obviously FC Barcelona biased, but as you know via my articles, I'm critical of my club, including toward Lionel Messi, and I give credit where credit is due to whomever. That being said, I am furious that there is a clear bias toward ""certain other clubs"" in Spain by the referees. There, I said it.

Xavi gets tripped inside the penalty box. If that was@Cristiano, the ref would've given a PK and sent off the opponent.


Early in the second half, Neymar was brought down inside the box, and once again, the referee didn't see a penalty—probably because Neymar wasn't wearing a white shirt.

How is this not a penalty?????#Barca#neymarRef gave Ronaldo one for an outrageous dive!!!https://t.co/aqy2kL3qZH



No PK given???!!! Wow! Liga refs just gonna give ALL the penalties to@Cristianothis season....


Meanwhile, Liga referees consider THIS a penalty...

.@Cristianoshows why no one should take his goal records seriously this season. Dives & PKs. RT@Emenderk:pic.twitter.com/EpjzcGCxC1



No hate intended, but I'll never understand how Cristiano has gotten rid of his diver-stigma but players like Busquets haven't.


¡Qué asco!Makes me sick!
We must learn to accept the sad fact that FC Barcelona and the rest of La Liga not namedReal Madridis not playing against XI every match; they are playing against XIV: 11 from the opposing team ALONG WITH one referee and two line judges.
Thankfully, the football world has its D10S to show all how to score hat tricks without referees helping nor diving.

His 3rd hattrick within his last 4 games, 0 penalties!pic.twitter.com/GrJZavXcDn


Can you remember the last time Messi dived in a game?
...
Yup, me neither.
Messi is always battling. He's a fighter whose had to earn his way to the top the hard way. Yes, Ronaldo has overcome quite a bit as well and also worked hard to get to where he is at. But unlike Ronaldo, who once he got to star status, he relied (and still relies) on flops, referee biases and his star status to get the benefit of the doubt on calls, Lionel Messi wants to earn all of his goals, assists, and team wins the right way, the hard way, and always fair.
And that's why he is respected by most (except Madridistas). Messi represents us. He's a fighter who isn't satisfied with what he's earned; he wants more. He's overcome too much to stop and conform. Leo is determined to go through everyone, if he has to, to reach his goal and lift his people (team) up. Catalunya has always had to fight, and Catalunya has another fighter in Messi. While Cristiano, who is a major talent, is today more of a representation of privilege and the spoiled, diva life, Messi is the representation of the blue-collar, hard-working, overcoming great odds to make it—yet, staying humble and always doing this the right way. Messi is a true role model for all; the same cannot be said about another player. Messi doesn't want anything given to him; he wants to earn it. And if you don't believe me, just rememberLeo's reactionwhen he won the Golden Ball at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final.
And who doesn't love a story like Leo Messi's? Hollywood loves it, as the trailer for ""Messi"", the biopic directed by Alex de la Iglesa, will be released on New Year's Day. Watch the trailer (but after you finishing reading this editorial).

I know it shouldn't be all about Messi vs. Cristiano. As mentioned, CR7 is a solid player, we cannot deny. But it's sad and pathetic that such a talent like Ronaldo has to rely on flops, dives, and Oscar-worthy performances to get ahead in football. Personally, I guess I can't stand the fact that some fans and media praise a cheat while bashing the honest player. I know that's how it has always been, but I'll never truly accept it.
Have you seen Leo chew out a teammate? I know I've seen another player do that.
I've seen Messi always be respectful in defeat; I can't say the same for another player.
I've seen Messi point to the heavens and give thanks for a goal while celebrating with his teammates; I've seen another player run to the corner flag, point to himself and act like an arrogant fool.
Some fans and media destroy Messi for ""not doing enough"" yet completely gives CR7 as pass when he fails. CR7 flops, nothing wrong; Messi makes an error, he's ""not interested"" or ""he's not the same anymore."" In a ""down season"" for Messi, he ""magically"" has similar stats than Ronaldo, not to mention, led his country to the World Cup Final...but it's Ronaldo that's having a career year?
How sad for Ronaldo that his ""best year"" of his career is considered a down year by Messi standards.

17 of Messi's 21 Liga hat-tricks are pure hat-tricks, not including any penalty or dive#fcbliveRonaldo: 9 pure ones of 23 [via@messistat]


One player will always be the darling of the media, referees, and Liga, UEFA and FIFA officials, while the other one will be the be and already is the greatest footballer of all-time who doesn't rely on refs or favoritism by media or football governing body officials to ""dictate"" his game, his records or his stats.
If Messi is a dictator, then comrades, I will follow my Generalísimo Lionel Andres Messi Cuccittini till the end.

#D10Sis KING RT@geniusfootball:#Messiis the king.pic.twitter.com/d0o5HBGUcV


As it has been mentioned before: Ronaldo is always compared with Messi. Messi is always compared with Pelé, Maradona and Cruyff.
There's a reason for that.
You can like whomever. I'm done. For me, I like people who get things done the right, honest way with class and humility. The debate will never end, but for me, there is no debate. You only have to be a fool, deaf and/or blind not to recognize and accept the greatness that is Lionel Messi as well as the role model traits he embodies.
UP NEXT:a battle against PSG at the Camp Nou in the last UEFA Champions League group stage match. If Barcelona wins, they secure the top spot in Group F. A win or draw by PSG and the Parisians win Group F.
For me,Luis Enriquehas to go with a lineup of: Marc-Andre ter Stegen; Alba, Mathieu, Pique, Adriano; Busquets, Rakitic, Iniesta; Neymar, Messi, Suarez. As much as I likeJavier MascheranoandMarc Bartra, I'd prefer Jeremy Mathieu at CB for the height and speed factor. With Dani Alves out due to yellow cards, Adriano is experienced and is able to play RB. At 6'5"", Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be ready to pounce, and the 6'3"" and quick Mathieu would work alongside Pique covering Zlatan. I'd use Xavi as a substitute and Andres Iniesta is ready to start alongside Ivan Rakitic. Luis Suarez, who had a subpar game against Espanyol, will hopefully cause chaos for the PSG defense.
Final Word

Lionel Messi brings FC Barcelona back and the Blaugrana get the 5-1 win over RCD Espanyol on Sunday.
And THAT'S how you score a hat trick...
Said it before and I'll say it again: cherish every moment you watch Lionel Messi play because we are witnessing someone and something that will never be seen on this earth ever again. We are all truly blessed.

CR7 scored a hattrick with a penalty, tap in and rebound yesterday. Messi scores three utterly brilliant goals a day later.

The world’s greatest game -el Clasico- is coming up and so is the award season.France Football and FIFA have merged their awards (the Ballon d’Or and FIFA World Footballer of the Year) to reward the most outstanding player of the year with the inaugural FIFA Ballon d’Or trophy.
But unlike in previous seasons, neitherLionel Messinor Cristiano Ronaldo will finish among the top three contenders. From 2007 onwards those two managed appear in the top three of either award ceremony.

This year’s favorites to win the (now single) award, Spanish World Champions Xavi and Andres Iniesta as well as Inter’s treble winner Wesley Sneijder. The latter seems to be the odds-on favorite to win the first ever FIFA Ballon d’Or, having led Inter to an historic treble and the Dutch national team to the World Cup final.
Nonetheless, it is a World Cup year and judging by past recipients it’s more than likely the award will be handed to a Spanish player. While Sneijder accomplished the treble with Inter, he hardly covered new ground, Xavi and Iniesta did it a year earlier. Not to say that accomplishing the treble is an easy feat, far from it, but winning the World Cup is even more prestigious. After all, the tournament is only held every four years.

In any case, Messi and Ronaldo will probably not appear among the top three nominees. But that hasn’t stopped the pair from starting the 2010/2011 campaign in spectacular fashion.

La Pulga (Lionel Messi) has scored a ridiculous 19 goals in just 16 appearances (all competitions) and created another seven goals for his teammates.
CR7’s statistics are impressive as well; he scored 15 goals in 19 appearances and assisted a further eight goals.



But even off the pitch their ""rivalry"" is remarkable. Being recognized as two of the world’s premier footballers; it is only natural that they lend their image and name for product endorsements such as Pepsi, the Pro Evolution or FIFA series amongst others.
Needless to say, the annual earnings of those two are off the charts with Messi having a slight advantage over Ronaldo.


And speaking of endorsements, it seems Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo were destined to be rivals. Not only do they play for FC Barcelona and the team from the Spanish capital, that have one of the most intense rivalries in club football, they also wear boots from rival companies Adidas & Nike who share a somewhat different kind of rivalry themselves.

It appears as if La Pulga and CR7 are competing in every area, and considering the fact that both are relatively young (Messi is 23, Ronaldo is 25) there’s no end in sight. Under the right circumstances and provided they stay injury-free, this could very well become the greatest rivalry in football of all-time.

Messi has been key to Barca’s title charge and has been in prolific form again this season, scoring 28 times in La Liga in 2020-21 to top the scoring charts once more.
Saul’s in no doubt about the Barcelona captain’s quality.
“There is no doubt that Lionel Messi is the best player in history, not just currently,” he said.
“I admire Cristiano for how he works, how he is, but I think Messi, at a footballing level, has no comparison.”

Barcelona star Lionel Messi was the Man of the Match today as Argentina narrowly beat Portugal 2-1. The best player in the world assisted Di Maria for the 1-0 in the first half and then scored the winning goal at the 90th minute from the penalty spot. Captain Mascherano and Gabriel Milito also started the match and helped Argentina beat a revitalized Portugal side, who had in Nani their stand-out player.New manager Sergio Batista has built his system around Messi and that has been paying dividends, as expected. After scoring against Brazil in November, Messi now had a great match against Portugal and led his team to victory again. He played in the same position he does at Barcelona and the results were fantastic; his assist to Di Maria was quite simply amazing, as the Real Madrid player admitted.
With a new manager and a system in some ways similar to Barcelona's, Lionel Messi seems poised to lead Argentina to the Copa America title in the summer.
This was overall a very successful day for Barcelona players, as Abidal had a solid performance in France's 1-0 win over Brazil and Spain beat Colombia with several Barcelona players. Afellay also had a very good game, helping Holland beat Austria 3-1.
More importantly, no one got injured and Barcelona will face the challenges ahead (Gijon and Arsenal) almost at full strength - only captain Carles Puyol is out and he should be back soon.

FT: FC Barcelona 5-0 Levante
Xoel's Take
Barça had many chances to score goals, but bad luck and bad refereeing didn't allow this. Nevertheless, there is not much to complain about.
Marc Bartra had a beast of a game against Levante. Marc hasn't played in a while, and against Levante, he wasn't going to hold anything back. Marc had terrific blocks and ran down Levante forwards with ease.Marc Bartra'sawareness to steal the ball and give the smooth pass to Leo for the second Barcelona goal was just another example of why Bartra has ""Puyol-esque"" qualities. With all due respect to Sergio Busquets, I think Busi should give the No. 5 to Marc Bartra. The kid has shown he has the heart, leadership skills, and awareness of el Capità. Hopefully, we'll see Marc play in some ""big"" games this season (Champions League, Copa semi or final, etc.).
Pedro had a solid game. The Canarian did not grab a goal, but his hustle helped open up play in the Barça attack. Pedrito grabbed an assist, as he fed an open Messi for the third FCB goal. He even ran a Levante forward down to help out in defense in the first half. Pedro may not be the Pedro of 2010-11, but he is still capable of coming into games like this and causing problems for the opponent with his hustle and speed.

Neymar marca su gol 39 con la camiseta del FCBarcelona y deja atrás a Maradona (38).pic.twitter.com/hcNF2gh12b


Neymar scored his 39th goal with FC Barcelona. The Brazilian surpassed Diego Maradona in the all-time Barça goal-scoring list.
Neymar was outstanding. This past week againstVillarrealin the Copa del Rey semifinal, first leg, Neymar had a poor game that included a penalty kick saved. Neymar needed a good bounce-back game, and against Levante, he had just that. Beautiful finish by Ney on his lone goal of the night. Neymar is now the sixth Barça player to whom Messi has given 10 or more assists. Neymar could have had a goal or two more as well as assists in the match, but a bit of bad luck with some passes toward Messi prevented Neymar from having a better statistical game. But that's OK. Neymar got the bounce-back game he needed. Great to see Luis Suarez get a goal. And what a goal it was! Suarez was itching to get into the game, and off the bench came Luisito to get his golazo. As I've previously stated, we have yet to see the best of Luis Suarez at Barcelona. Hopefully, we see it begin now. Personally, I think it would be fitting if we see a Luis Suarez brace in Manchester when Barcelona take on Man City. Suarez scoring in England to defeat an old rival would be poetic.
No one on Barcelona had a ""bad"" game. Adriano and Martin Montoya held down the back line.Javier Mascheranowas solid. The midfield was fine, as Xavi, Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets played well. Lastly,Claudio Bravoheld down the fort, as he made the saves when needed and grabbed another shutout this season.
Messi's World
It's Leo Messi's world, as the Argentine #D10S grabbed another hat trick against Levante. Lionel Messi is not only the best goal-scorer; he's the best assister, as his wonder cross to Neymar was just another example of his greatness. With his assist to Neymar, Messi (106) surpassed Luis Figo (105) for the most assists in La Liga in the last 25 years.
Lionel Messi has equaled Cristano Ronaldo for the most hat tricks in ever in La Liga (not counting Copa del Rey and Spanish SuperCup) with 23 hat tricks. Leo has also equaled Telmo Zarra as the players with most hat tricks ever (31) in the history of Spanish football. Messi now has the most club goals (37) in Spanish football this season (all competitions), surpassing Ronaldo.
Leo Messi has now played in 500 games for FC Barcelona, official games and friendlies:
Games:500
Goals:419
Assists:162
Via ESPN Deportes' Mr. Chip: Lionel Messi scored 348 goals in 348 games for FC Barcelona since June 2008, when Pep Guardiola became the first-squad manager. One goal every 83 minutes.
A goal per game! Unreal and unexplainable!
Then again, Leo Messi is unreal and unexplainable himself. Words cannot describe his greatness. We will have to invent new words to try to explain Lionel Messi because ""magic"", ""greatest ever"", ""D10S"", and all other words are simply not doing Messi justice.

Lionel Andres Messi: The Legend continues...

Xoel's Final Word
Barcelona keeps rolling, as El Blaugrana defeated Levante 5-0 at the Camp Nou on Sunday. With the win, FC Barcelona has now won 11 games in a row, equaling the best win streak during the Pep Guardiola era (2008-12).
Messi dominates, Neymar continues to get better, and FC Barcelona continues to be on fire.
Let the Barça fire burn the football world.

FCBarcelonadefeated Getafe 4-0 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night.Cesc Fabregasgrabbed a brace on the night, and the team played well, overall. But let's face be honest, the night belonged to the return of the King. The night belonged toLionel Messi.
Heading into the last thirty minutes, I was a bit disappointed that the team was not up two or three goals. But once Leo got up from the bench and started warming up, I knew a goal was on its way. But I'd be lying if I said I felt that Messi was going to score two goals.
Cesc converted the penalty kick and made it 2-0 just before the King made his return in the 64thminute of the game, coming in for Andres Iniesta. You could tell that Leo's teammates were doing all that they could to get Messi the ball. They wanted Leo to get the ball, and get those magical legs of his warmed up.
The game looked like it was going to end 2-0, but Leo was about to make a statement.
A great pass bySergio Busquetswas brought down byMartin Montoya, who was able to maintain control of the ball inside the box only to have the ball deflect off a Getafe defender, and find the feet of Messi who put it in the back of net for the 3-0 score line. Call it luck; call it whatever you'd like, but the bottom line is that Lionel Messi knows where to be on the pitch at the right time. And no, not all players are capable of doing that.
Just when it looked like that was that, Messi decides to reiterate why he is the greatest in the world.
Less than four minutes after his ""Welcome Back"" goal, Messi got the ball thanks to anAlex Songpass, dribbled down the right side—playing the RW spot like old times sake—moved past one defender, closed in on the box, and delivered a smooth strike to the near post,grabbing his brace on the night. Getafe was stunned and, to an extent, many fans watching the game where stunned—but in a good way. Lionel Messi jogged toward the corner flag with his arms open, then pounded his chest close to the Barcelona crest on his kit, in a way telling all Culés and all of FC Barcelona, ""I'm back. I love this game. I love all of you.""
The feeling is mutual, Leo.
Messi's brace essentially sealedGetafe'sfate in the Copa del Rey, and will give Barcelona the opportunity to rest a few players for the second leg, which is great because Barça has a busy schedule.
Wednesday night's performance by Leo is a reminder to all football fans, not just Culés, that Lionel Messi is the only player in the world that can capture our hearts and our imagination. There is no other player that makes us feel the way Lionel Messi does. There are many great players in football, but none come anywhere close to Messi's greatness.
I wasn't alive when Pelé was playing. I was two years of age when Diego Maradona won the 1986World Cupin Mexico. I do not have memories of Pelé, and my only memories of Maradona were of his final playing years, which involved drugs and other personal issues he was battling. That being said, I obviously cannot say that seeing Messi play is just like it was when people saw Pelé or Maradona play. I respect both players, but with the amount of media we have in our world nowadays, the world is blessed to get the opportunity to see Messi play on a weekly basis, and for me, there has never been a player like Leo. Messi is truly a force of nature.
The only professional athlete that, in my opinion, compares to the magic, skill, determination, and heart of Lionel Messi is Michael Jordan.
There were many great players in the NBA during the Jordan Era (late 1980s-late 1990s), but the fact that we call this time period in the NBA the Jordan Era is proof enough that none of the great players during this time period had as big of an impact as Michael Jordan. But it wasn't only because of the titles, it was because of the magic, the skill, determination and the heart Michael showed on the court every night. We see and have always seen the same thing with Leo Messi. There are other terrific footballers out there likeCristiano Ronaldo, whom even though I do not like, I do respect his game and his game only, none of them will be as beloved as Messi. We have been and are living in the Messi Era. And just like the great NBA players that played during the Jordan Era were always behind Michael's greatness, all the current terrific footballers will fall behind Leo's greatness.
Even if you were not a Chicago Bulls fan in the late 80s or 1990s, you still tuned in to see the Bulls play because of Jordan. Many people became Bulls fans solely because of Jordan. Again, we see the same thing with Lionel Messi. Many tune in to see Leo play, even if they are not Barça fans. Greatness is greatness, regardless of which team the player is on. Perhaps the only fan base that does not tune in areReal Madridfans. Then again, as we all know, Madridistas are only interested in enhancing their and their club's own ego, which has been built around buying players and titles; arrogance; debt; side deals with businesses, businessmen, and media outlets; and believing/spreading lies to further hide their and their club's shortcomings.
Given it is in a different sport and in a different time, we can't deny that Michael Jordan and Lionel Messi are similar when it comes to capturing our hearts and imagination. What I mean by that is that when we, those who saw Jordan play back in the day, watched Michael play, Jordan made us feel like a kid again every night he was playing. Jordan was a superhero, and we watched as the hero did the incredible over and over again. That is what we saw with Messi on Wednesday night! We saw our beloved hero put on his cape (or boots), walk out, and do the incredible. I am a lifelong sports fan, and seeing Messi's second goal made me feel like a kid again. It reminded me of how I felt like when I'd watch Jordan back as a kid back in the 90s. Then again, I have felt like a child watching a superhero in action when seeing Messi play for years now, and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. I also know many, many non-Barcelona fans that feel this way as well. One thing that's obvious is that Messi is more humbler than Jordan was, and that is a big reason why Messi is so beloved as well.
I understand and respect making the case that Messi needs to win a World Cup to truly be football's greatest of all time. Winning an NBA title like Jordan did six times is still an easier challenge than winning a World Cup, which is in my opinion the toughest title to win in any sport in the world. Personally, I don't feel Messi needs to win a World Cup to be the greatest of all time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a Culé. Even if Messi were at any other team, I'd feel the same way. Yes, even if he were at Real Madrid, and as much as I would hate to admit it, I would say Messi was/is the greatest ever. But thankfully, he is Barça's, and we Culés and all football fans around the world are his audience to show him the love and respect he has earned.
It's obvious that Michael Jordan has had and currently has a greater impact in defining what is greatness in sports as of now because Jordan's career is complete and Leo's isn't. But I truly believe when it's all said and done that Lionel Messi will be alongside Michael Jordan's name when measuring greatness in sports. Maybe we have reached that point already. Lionel Messi, like Michael Jordan, has changed his sport forever, transcends sports, and has made a global impact with his play and greatness.
Am I making too much of two late goals in a game? I'm sure some reading this article are thinking that's the case. That's OK.  It's not my intention to do that, but everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. And seeing Messi's triumphant return to football by scoring those late goals made me feel like I kid again; made me feel like I felt when I watchedPep Guardiolaback in the day, then Xavi play for the first time. But Messi's greatness, with a small sample of that displayed by his triumphant return on Wednesday night, reminded me the most of Michael Jordan's greatness. Yes, it's two completely different sports, but the emotions, creativity, greatness, heart, competitive spirit, ability to capture fans' imaginations, and love for the game are a mirror images of each other—and that is the reason I wrote this article. I write what comes to me in the moment, never scripted, and I don't apologize for this. Everything comes from my Culé mind and heart.
When comparing Michael Jordan to the rest of the great players in basketball history, basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson once said, ""There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.""
The same kind of comparison goes in football and comparing Lionel Messi to other footballers both currently playing and in football history:
There's Lionel Messi and then there is the rest of them.
Welcome back, King Leo.

He has character, determination and this year he has been decisive on many occasions."" - Massimiliano Allegri
With AC Milan about to lose their lead in the Serie A to Inter and facing Champions League elimination at the hands of Tottenham, their manager seems to have been particularly affected.
According to Max Allegri, Ibrahimovic is on the same level as Lionel Messi. It seems clear that Allegri is being rather generous to Lionel Messi, who hasn't done anything to even be mentioned in the same sentence as the great Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Messi's 40 goals by early February are hardly setting world on fire, unlike Ibrahimovic, who has scored more than 40 goals on.... well, actually he has never even scored more than 30 goals in a single season, but who cares, really? Unlike Messi, Zlatan is a big game player and saves his goals for the biggest occasions; he has scored 26 goals in 82 European appearances, two of which in the knockout rounds. Messi's 31 goals in 50 appearances look pale in comparison.
Last season ended all doubts. Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved to Barcelona and outshined Lionel Messi week in, week out. Messi's jealousy was the reason why Ibraflop eventually got benched and 20-year-old Bojan Krkic took his place in the lineup. It's also the reason why Pedro, a winger in his first year as a professional player, ended up scoring more goals than Zlatan ""I ran less than Valdés against Inter"" Ibrahimovic.
Finally, their career numbers show that Ibraflop is much better than Leo Messi: at 23 years old, Messi, who's not even a striker, has only scored 167 goals in 247 matches. Ibrahimovic, at 29, has scored a lot more goals: 198 in 421 (!) matches!
Seriously Mr. Allegri, what drugs are you on and can I have some?
Ibrahimovic isn't even the best striker in the Serie A. That title belongs to Samuel Eto'o. You know, the guy who won three Champions League titles, scoring in two of the finals, the best African striker of all-time. The guy who has scored ten more goals than Ibrahimovic this season!
But is Ibraflop even the second best striker in Italy right now? 23-year-old Edinson Cavani would beg to differ. The Uruguyan has scored more goals in the Serie A than Ibraflop in all competitions, while having a much inferior supporting cast around him at Napoli. And what about Diego Milito, who did in one year what Zlatan tried (and failed to do) for three years: leading Inter to European glory with clutch goals?
Is he better than Cristiano Ronaldo? David Villa? Andrés Iniesta? The answer is NO!
Maybe Mr. Allegri was just trying to be funny, but some things are just too ridiculous to say. Next thing we know Juventus manager will be hailing Amauri as the best player in the world!
Massimiliano Allegri is the undisputed Barca Blaugranes Stinker of the Week!

FCBarcelonadefeated Getafe 4-0 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night.Cesc Fabregasgrabbed a brace on the night, and the team played well, overall. But let's face be honest, the night belonged to the return of the King. The night belonged toLionel Messi.
Heading into the last thirty minutes, I was a bit disappointed that the team was not up two or three goals. But once Leo got up from the bench and started warming up, I knew a goal was on its way. But I'd be lying if I said I felt that Messi was going to score two goals.
Cesc converted the penalty kick and made it 2-0 just before the King made his return in the 64thminute of the game, coming in for Andres Iniesta. You could tell that Leo's teammates were doing all that they could to get Messi the ball. They wanted Leo to get the ball, and get those magical legs of his warmed up.
The game looked like it was going to end 2-0, but Leo was about to make a statement.
A great pass bySergio Busquetswas brought down byMartin Montoya, who was able to maintain control of the ball inside the box only to have the ball deflect off a Getafe defender, and find the feet of Messi who put it in the back of net for the 3-0 score line. Call it luck; call it whatever you'd like, but the bottom line is that Lionel Messi knows where to be on the pitch at the right time. And no, not all players are capable of doing that.
Just when it looked like that was that, Messi decides to reiterate why he is the greatest in the world.
Less than four minutes after his ""Welcome Back"" goal, Messi got the ball thanks to anAlex Songpass, dribbled down the right side—playing the RW spot like old times sake—moved past one defender, closed in on the box, and delivered a smooth strike to the near post,grabbing his brace on the night. Getafe was stunned and, to an extent, many fans watching the game where stunned—but in a good way. Lionel Messi jogged toward the corner flag with his arms open, then pounded his chest close to the Barcelona crest on his kit, in a way telling all Culés and all of FC Barcelona, ""I'm back. I love this game. I love all of you.""
The feeling is mutual, Leo.
Messi's brace essentially sealedGetafe'sfate in the Copa del Rey, and will give Barcelona the opportunity to rest a few players for the second leg, which is great because Barça has a busy schedule.
Wednesday night's performance by Leo is a reminder to all football fans, not just Culés, that Lionel Messi is the only player in the world that can capture our hearts and our imagination. There is no other player that makes us feel the way Lionel Messi does. There are many great players in football, but none come anywhere close to Messi's greatness.
I wasn't alive when Pelé was playing. I was two years of age when Diego Maradona won the 1986World Cupin Mexico. I do not have memories of Pelé, and my only memories of Maradona were of his final playing years, which involved drugs and other personal issues he was battling. That being said, I obviously cannot say that seeing Messi play is just like it was when people saw Pelé or Maradona play. I respect both players, but with the amount of media we have in our world nowadays, the world is blessed to get the opportunity to see Messi play on a weekly basis, and for me, there has never been a player like Leo. Messi is truly a force of nature.
The only professional athlete that, in my opinion, compares to the magic, skill, determination, and heart of Lionel Messi is Michael Jordan.
There were many great players in the NBA during the Jordan Era (late 1980s-late 1990s), but the fact that we call this time period in the NBA the Jordan Era is proof enough that none of the great players during this time period had as big of an impact as Michael Jordan. But it wasn't only because of the titles, it was because of the magic, the skill, determination and the heart Michael showed on the court every night. We see and have always seen the same thing with Leo Messi. There are other terrific footballers out there likeCristiano Ronaldo, whom even though I do not like, I do respect his game and his game only, none of them will be as beloved as Messi. We have been and are living in the Messi Era. And just like the great NBA players that played during the Jordan Era were always behind Michael's greatness, all the current terrific footballers will fall behind Leo's greatness.
Even if you were not a Chicago Bulls fan in the late 80s or 1990s, you still tuned in to see the Bulls play because of Jordan. Many people became Bulls fans solely because of Jordan. Again, we see the same thing with Lionel Messi. Many tune in to see Leo play, even if they are not Barça fans. Greatness is greatness, regardless of which team the player is on. Perhaps the only fan base that does not tune in areReal Madridfans. Then again, as we all know, Madridistas are only interested in enhancing their and their club's own ego, which has been built around buying players and titles; arrogance; debt; side deals with businesses, businessmen, and media outlets; and believing/spreading lies to further hide their and their club's shortcomings.
Given it is in a different sport and in a different time, we can't deny that Michael Jordan and Lionel Messi are similar when it comes to capturing our hearts and imagination. What I mean by that is that when we, those who saw Jordan play back in the day, watched Michael play, Jordan made us feel like a kid again every night he was playing. Jordan was a superhero, and we watched as the hero did the incredible over and over again. That is what we saw with Messi on Wednesday night! We saw our beloved hero put on his cape (or boots), walk out, and do the incredible. I am a lifelong sports fan, and seeing Messi's second goal made me feel like a kid again. It reminded me of how I felt like when I'd watch Jordan back as a kid back in the 90s. Then again, I have felt like a child watching a superhero in action when seeing Messi play for years now, and I know I'm not the only one that feels this way. I also know many, many non-Barcelona fans that feel this way as well. One thing that's obvious is that Messi is more humbler than Jordan was, and that is a big reason why Messi is so beloved as well.
I understand and respect making the case that Messi needs to win a World Cup to truly be football's greatest of all time. Winning an NBA title like Jordan did six times is still an easier challenge than winning a World Cup, which is in my opinion the toughest title to win in any sport in the world. Personally, I don't feel Messi needs to win a World Cup to be the greatest of all time, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a Culé. Even if Messi were at any other team, I'd feel the same way. Yes, even if he were at Real Madrid, and as much as I would hate to admit it, I would say Messi was/is the greatest ever. But thankfully, he is Barça's, and we Culés and all football fans around the world are his audience to show him the love and respect he has earned.
It's obvious that Michael Jordan has had and currently has a greater impact in defining what is greatness in sports as of now because Jordan's career is complete and Leo's isn't. But I truly believe when it's all said and done that Lionel Messi will be alongside Michael Jordan's name when measuring greatness in sports. Maybe we have reached that point already. Lionel Messi, like Michael Jordan, has changed his sport forever, transcends sports, and has made a global impact with his play and greatness.
Am I making too much of two late goals in a game? I'm sure some reading this article are thinking that's the case. That's OK.  It's not my intention to do that, but everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. And seeing Messi's triumphant return to football by scoring those late goals made me feel like I kid again; made me feel like I felt when I watchedPep Guardiolaback in the day, then Xavi play for the first time. But Messi's greatness, with a small sample of that displayed by his triumphant return on Wednesday night, reminded me the most of Michael Jordan's greatness. Yes, it's two completely different sports, but the emotions, creativity, greatness, heart, competitive spirit, ability to capture fans' imaginations, and love for the game are a mirror images of each other—and that is the reason I wrote this article. I write what comes to me in the moment, never scripted, and I don't apologize for this. Everything comes from my Culé mind and heart.
When comparing Michael Jordan to the rest of the great players in basketball history, basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson once said, ""There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.""
The same kind of comparison goes in football and comparing Lionel Messi to other footballers both currently playing and in football history:
There's Lionel Messi and then there is the rest of them.
Welcome back, King Leo.

“There has been a radical turnaround in the case of Lionel Messi’s renewal with Barcelona, with recent information being that the deal was close to being announced, yet a blockbuster revelation has suggested that Barcelona will now not be able to re-sign the Argentine,” claims the Madrid-based paper.
This news comes in stark contrast with previous reports, which claimed that an investment made by the company CVC into La Liga would make it easier for the Catalans to stay under the salary cap with Messi taking a 50% pay cut.
This new report says that while the cash injection would help, it would still keep the situation quite fraught in terms of the wage bill.
And one big complication is that were La Liga to accept the cash injection, the big teams would be forced to abandon the European Super League concept. This is something thatReal Madridand Barcelona are resistant to doing.
This means that, according to MARCA, we are left with “a situation whereby Barcelona extending Messi’s contract and moving forward with the Super League plans are impossible to do together.”
Multiple sources and reporters have been unable to confirm or deny the rumor.
However, there is a report fromCatalan radio which saysthat while it’s true that things are more complicated than first expected, it is still not impossible for Messi to continue at Barcelona.

Lionel Messi and André Gomes will return earlier than expected from their national teams after picking up injuries for Argentina and Portugal on Thursday's matches, with both traveling to Catalonia on Saturday to undergo tests with the club's medical staff to determine the extent of their injuries.
Let's start with Messi, who played all 90 minutes and scored the game-winning goal for theAlbicelestein their 1-0 victory against Luis Suárez's Uruguay, has been ruled out of the next game against Venezuela, next Tuesday. The Argentine FA released a statement regarding Messi's problem:
""This morning, Lionel Messi underwent medical and kinesiological treatment for a groin and thigh pain. It is recommended that he continue to rest from activity and he will not play against Venezuela in the eighth game of World Cup qualifying for Russia 2018.""
Source:Diario Sport
Messi has a groin injury that's been causing pain since the lastLa Ligamatch against Athletic Bilbao. This is a common problem that players suffer at the beginning of every season, especially since Leo played seven games in 23 days for Barça dating back to preseason. But if left untreated and there is more accumulation of games, it could lead to a more serious issue, so Messi will rest all of next week and could even be rested by Luis Enrique ahead of the Champions League debut against Celtic in 10 days.
André Gomes played less than 30 minutes after coming on as a substitute in Portugal's friendly against Gibraltar, and had to come off after picking up a knock to his leg. Further testing by the national team medical staff revealed that Gomes' pain could be from a muscular injury, and he needed to return to Barcelona to assess the state of his contusion.
As of right now it does not look like Messi and Gomes have serious issues, but we'll only know for sure when Barça conduct further testing and announce the extent of the injuries. Here's hoping it's nothing major and they're healthy for the Champions League.

It’s widely believed that Busquets will leave European football altogether, and Messi took some time to make a post on his official Instagram to praise his former teammate.
This has led some to claim that it’s more proof of a long-rumored split between Messi and Gerard Piqué, because the Argentine made no such post when the defender retired recently.
The two were longtime teammates and have shared as much time together as Messi and Busquets in the Barcelona first team. In fact, the relationship between Messi and Piqué stretches further, to when Messi first joined the Barcelona youth team that the Catalan defender was on.
Supposedly, the spat dates back to 2021. This was when Piqué reportedly told club president Joan Laporta to let Lionel Messi go for financial reasons. That led to a tearful Messi leaving Barcelona, his second home after his native Rosario, and joining Paris Saint-Germain.
Piqué’s lobbying was a betrayal in the Argentine’s eyes, or so they say.
Whether that’s true or not, who’s to say? But it has been reported in all major sports dailies in Spain, and certainly, Messi’s choices when it comes to Instagram post is fueling the speculation.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0PBPXR-DkLlOGdFkbClPcCNnBg=/0x0:6720x4480/320x213/filters:focal(3052x841:4126x1915)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72268515/1211579535.0.jpg

Let’s be very clear here, the likelihood of Messi and Neymar playing together again is low. The likelihood that the story of it happening would be broken by Neymar posting a photo of the two saying they had an announcement is even lower.
However, after seeing this the first thing I thought of is what sort of ridiculous announcement this could end up being and I wanted to see what you guys thought. Personally, I see this ending up in the arena of a breakfast cereal advertising campaign.

While that’s true, some take it too far and say he has no defensive contribution. That’s actually quite wrong.
Messi actually wins a respectable amount of balls back, and he’s become a specialist at one kind of ball recovery in particular - winning the ball back in the offensive third.
In fact, according to WhoScored, Messi has recovered more balls in the opposing third than any other player in La Liga, having won possession back six times in this manner.

Of course, such a play is not just a defensive action, but also instantaneously an offensive action.
Relatedly, while he hasn’t done it as much forBarcelonaso far this season, he actually can be a pretty good tackler. Stats show that, in the FIFAWorld Cup, Messi won 1.3 tackles per game. For comparison’s sake, the forward with the most tackles per game was Mario Mandžukić, who had 2. Eden Hazard had 0.7, Romelu Lukaku and Harry Kane had 0.2 each, and Cristiano Ronaldo 0.

Another day at the office you say? It's certainly looking that way as the marvelous Argentine can't seem to make it a game without rewriting the record books.
Today he became the first Barcelona player to score two hat-tricks in El Clasico history. Think about it for a second, with all the star power Barcelona possessed over its storied history, nobody has ever scored two hat-tricks against Real Madrid. He is also the first player to score a hat-trick against a team managed byCarlo Ancelotti
With his second goal of the night Messi also became the top foreign La Liga goalscorer, breaking Hugo Sánchez record of 234 that stood since 1994. As we all know Messi went on to add another goal to bring his La Liga count to 236 goals.
And to round that off, Real Madrid is now Messi's favorite target in all competitions as the 21 goals he scored against the Madrid team tops the charts. If you were wondering, Atletico Madrid is a distant second on that table with 20 goals against. The 21 goals scored in El Clasico history also represents a record, a record that Messi until today shared with Alfredo Di Stéfano. After the hat-trick the duo are now also tied for most La Liga El Clasico goals with 14.
Picking up an assist on Iniesta's opener Messi also extended his own record of most assists in El Clasico history. His count has now reached 12 which tops both teams in this category.
Words fail to describe Messi's greatness, but maybe the record book will be able to fully grasp the wonder that is Lionel Messi

While Luka Modric won the FIFA Men’s Player of the Year Award for 2018 with 29.05% of the vote, Messi amassed only 9.81%, landing him in fifth place behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Mohamed Salah and Kylian Mbappe. The Ballon d’ Or awards followed a strikingly similar plot, with Messi finishing yet again in fifth place in the men’s category behind Modric, Ronaldo,Antoine Griezmannand Mbappe. To many, such occurrences seem bizarre given Messi’s achievements this season, most recently his 50th career hat-trick againstSevilla.
Despite such controversial results, Messi’s status as Barca’s talisman remains intact as he looks to hoist Barca to La Liga, Copa del Rey andChampions Leaguevictories. Let’s take a look at the Argentine’s performances for the season thus far in order to get a better idea of the impact that he may have on the rest of Barca’s season, and whether or not age may yet be a factor when it comes to the Barca captain’s positive impact on his squad.
Starting with La Liga, Messi has proved as formidable as ever, scoring 25 goals and grabbing 13 assists in just 24 matches, thus topping the Liga scoring charts and far exceeding second-placed Suarez’s 16 goals.  He also impressively tops the list of most assists.
Looking more closely at the performances that earned him such an impressive record of results, it is evident that Messi proves just as clinical against top opposition as he is when facing the league’s minnows. He netted a total of three goals againstValenciain both fixtures this season, scored four in total against Sevilla including his most recent hat-trick, and grabbed an assist in the bitter 1-1 draw with Atletico earlier in the season. He also grabbed braces against high-flying Alaves and local rivalsEspanyol. Such results prove Messi’s consistency week in and week out, as well as his ability to perform against any opponent regardless of calibre.
What makes his achievements thus far this season even more admirable is the fact that he maintained his quality despite suffering from a forearm fracture that saw him left out of the squad for the games againstReal MadridandRayo Vallecano. Clearly, no mountain is too steep for Barca’s number 10 to climb.
Shifting focus to the European stage, the Blaugranes found themselves in a gruelling Champions League Group B draw alongside Italian giants Inter Milan, Premier League elites Tottenham Hotspur, and current Dutch Eredivisie champions PSV Eindhoven.
Such tough competition did not phase the Blaugranes in the slightest, as they demolished their opponents on their way to winning the group with an impressive 16 points and wrapping up the group stage undefeated. On the way to achieving such excellent results, club captain Messi certainly played his part, slotting away five goals in just four matches. Once again, the impressiveness of such results is only elevated considering that the Argentine was sidelined during both matches against Inter due to his aforementioned forearm fracture. While Barca’s away match against Lyon in the round of 16 remained goalless, it would certainly be expected for Messi to execute yet another impressive performance in order to assist the Blaugranes to overcome their latest opponents.
While form is only a temporary attribute, Lionel Messi has proven that he still has the match consistency, energy and influence on his teammates to take Barca forward in the long term. More importantly, he is a natural leader and effective club captain who also has the strong mentality needed to recover from a worrisome injury in an effort to bounce back and perform for his team. Clearly, age is but a number when it comes to thisBarcelonaicon, and any critics of Lionel Messi should surely be wary when their side is set to face his formidable Barca team.

“In my opinion one of the great secrets that Messi has managed to exploit very well is to be able to rest on the wing and be fresh when the ball arrives. He is fresh because he walks a long time. When he reaches it, he has a potential of 100%.
“First he feints and takes two, then he goes through the middle taking advantage of the rebound. Get into a particular frame of mind because the ball stays there. From the ground he manages to get up.
“Then he returns to demonstrate his skill and imagination. He finds himself in a completely new situation, with an opponent in front. He manages to unbalance it by pretending to take the ball to the right, finally he falls and scores because he frees space at the far post.”

FT: FC Barcelona 5-0 Levante
Xoel's Take
Barça had many chances to score goals, but bad luck and bad refereeing didn't allow this. Nevertheless, there is not much to complain about.
Marc Bartra had a beast of a game against Levante. Marc hasn't played in a while, and against Levante, he wasn't going to hold anything back. Marc had terrific blocks and ran down Levante forwards with ease.Marc Bartra'sawareness to steal the ball and give the smooth pass to Leo for the second Barcelona goal was just another example of why Bartra has ""Puyol-esque"" qualities. With all due respect to Sergio Busquets, I think Busi should give the No. 5 to Marc Bartra. The kid has shown he has the heart, leadership skills, and awareness of el Capità. Hopefully, we'll see Marc play in some ""big"" games this season (Champions League, Copa semi or final, etc.).
Pedro had a solid game. The Canarian did not grab a goal, but his hustle helped open up play in the Barça attack. Pedrito grabbed an assist, as he fed an open Messi for the third FCB goal. He even ran a Levante forward down to help out in defense in the first half. Pedro may not be the Pedro of 2010-11, but he is still capable of coming into games like this and causing problems for the opponent with his hustle and speed.

Neymar marca su gol 39 con la camiseta del FCBarcelona y deja atrás a Maradona (38).pic.twitter.com/hcNF2gh12b


Neymar scored his 39th goal with FC Barcelona. The Brazilian surpassed Diego Maradona in the all-time Barça goal-scoring list.
Neymar was outstanding. This past week againstVillarrealin the Copa del Rey semifinal, first leg, Neymar had a poor game that included a penalty kick saved. Neymar needed a good bounce-back game, and against Levante, he had just that. Beautiful finish by Ney on his lone goal of the night. Neymar is now the sixth Barça player to whom Messi has given 10 or more assists. Neymar could have had a goal or two more as well as assists in the match, but a bit of bad luck with some passes toward Messi prevented Neymar from having a better statistical game. But that's OK. Neymar got the bounce-back game he needed. Great to see Luis Suarez get a goal. And what a goal it was! Suarez was itching to get into the game, and off the bench came Luisito to get his golazo. As I've previously stated, we have yet to see the best of Luis Suarez at Barcelona. Hopefully, we see it begin now. Personally, I think it would be fitting if we see a Luis Suarez brace in Manchester when Barcelona take on Man City. Suarez scoring in England to defeat an old rival would be poetic.
No one on Barcelona had a ""bad"" game. Adriano and Martin Montoya held down the back line.Javier Mascheranowas solid. The midfield was fine, as Xavi, Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets played well. Lastly,Claudio Bravoheld down the fort, as he made the saves when needed and grabbed another shutout this season.
Messi's World
It's Leo Messi's world, as the Argentine #D10S grabbed another hat trick against Levante. Lionel Messi is not only the best goal-scorer; he's the best assister, as his wonder cross to Neymar was just another example of his greatness. With his assist to Neymar, Messi (106) surpassed Luis Figo (105) for the most assists in La Liga in the last 25 years.
Lionel Messi has equaled Cristano Ronaldo for the most hat tricks in ever in La Liga (not counting Copa del Rey and Spanish SuperCup) with 23 hat tricks. Leo has also equaled Telmo Zarra as the players with most hat tricks ever (31) in the history of Spanish football. Messi now has the most club goals (37) in Spanish football this season (all competitions), surpassing Ronaldo.
Leo Messi has now played in 500 games for FC Barcelona, official games and friendlies:
Games:500
Goals:419
Assists:162
Via ESPN Deportes' Mr. Chip: Lionel Messi scored 348 goals in 348 games for FC Barcelona since June 2008, when Pep Guardiola became the first-squad manager. One goal every 83 minutes.
A goal per game! Unreal and unexplainable!
Then again, Leo Messi is unreal and unexplainable himself. Words cannot describe his greatness. We will have to invent new words to try to explain Lionel Messi because ""magic"", ""greatest ever"", ""D10S"", and all other words are simply not doing Messi justice.

Xoel's Final Word
Barcelona keeps rolling, as El Blaugrana defeated Levante 5-0 at the Camp Nou on Sunday. With the win, FC Barcelona has now won 11 games in a row, equaling the best win streak during the Pep Guardiola era (2008-12).
Messi dominates, Neymar continues to get better, and FC Barcelona continues to be on fire.

The captain looked to have made it 2-1 to the hosts just before the hour mark but saw the goal wiped out after VAR ruled there had been a foul in the build-up.
“You screwed us twice!” was Messi’s reaction to the decision having previously been angered by referee Raphael Claus earlier in the match, according toSport.
TheBarcelonacaptain wasn’t too impressed when Paraguay were awarded a penalty after Miguel Almirón was fouled, as he felt there had been a similar offence earlier in the game which had gone unpunished.
Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni also called for more consistency from VAR after seeing his side held to a 1-1 draw.
“I think that in some way it is necessary to seek to unify the issue of the VAR. I am not talking in good or bad faith, but to unify criteria.”
Messi and Co. now head to Peru for their final World Cup qualifier of 2020. Ricardo Gareca’s side are still searching for their first win of the campaign after opening with a 2-2 draw against Paraguay and a 4-2 defeat to Brazil and take on Chile later today.

Newly elected club president Joan Laporta has made public and private assurances to the Argentine star that the club will do everything in their power to keep him.
However, a concrete deal has not been presented yet. At this point, Messi awaits an offer of a new deal before committing himself to at least another year at Barcelona.
The club is expected to send a proposal in the coming weeks, which would then lead to meetings between the player and the team’s top brass.
Up to this point, Laporta has done a financial analysis of the state of the club to see what kind of money they can offer, and has made some “preliminary contact” with the player’s entourage.
Messi attempted to leave the club last summer to joinManchester City, but Barcelona prevented him from leaving.
Laporta’s win in the presidential elections has provided a fresh start for Messi, who may be convinced to stay. City, for their part, are reportedly giving up on getting Messi, whom they assume will stay in Catalonia. However, Paris Saint-Germain are understood to still be in the running for the Argentine’s signature.
Barcelona will also soon be working on the renewal of Ousmane Dembélé and Ilaix Moriba, both of who have deals that expire next year. This comes after the club successfully renewed Álex Collado, an important Barcelona B player.

Fekir says Messi is the best footballer in the world but insists his team will do everything they can to keep him quiet when the two teams face off.
“Barcelonaare one of the best teams in Europe. It’s always fun to play against these kinds of teams. And it’s normal that the fans expect a lot from me in this match. We will give our all. Even if we know that it’s going to be a tough match,” he said.
“For me, he’s the best player in the world. I’ve already faced him on the pitch at theWorld Cup. Lionel Messi has been at the top for ten years. He’s been decisive every year. He wins trophies for his team. We will do our best to stop him.”

Fekir missed the first leg through suspension, and his return will boost Bruno Genesio’s side for the return leg.
Lyon managed to prevent Messi and Barcelona scoring in France but keeping them out at the Camp Nou is a different story altogether.

Now, there’s no need to be alarmist. Barcelona are a team coming off a disappointing, but certainly not disastrous season. They have a great squad. They have won important trophies recently.
On the other hand, Lionel Messi has a case for being the best player of all time. The standard is different since the possibilities are higher. We’re loath to admit it, but we are getting ever closer to Messi’s final years.
Therefore, it is clear that the board must do a better job of surrounding the Argentine with the absolute best players and staff, from first to last. Yes, a bit of luck is involved when it comes to results - sometimes a huge heaping of luck (Real Madrid’s Champions League triumph in 2016 comes to mind)... but we can agree, I think, that the work the board has done has been below par.
Messi clearly doesn’t always get on with the board, and I think the vast majority of fans back him 100% in that conflict. Make no mistake, Messi probably remains at Barcelona despite the board, not because of it. His loyalty is to the city, to the institution, and to his teammates.

“I have seen everywhere how many people want it to also be a good World Cup for me, that there is a desire to see me win it,” Messi he said.
”The truth is that it has struck me, that in any part of the world they are waiting for Argentina  to become the champions and for it to be given to me, it is impressive.”

Messi also discussed whether or not this would be his last World Cup, and what would happen should Argentina reach another final and fail to win.
“There is a feeling that much of this squad will be playing together  for the last time,” he added. “It seems that having reached three finals  doesn’t help.
”Obviously, we depend on the results, unfortunately. And that is behind the thinking about this whole group, right?
”That we reached three finals, which unfortunately we couldn’t win and many things were said about us.
”They don’t think about us getting closer to becoming champions, [they think] that we won’t have another chance.

Signing Messi, who was the best player at the last FIFA World Cup and is considered by some statistical measures to be the best player in the top five European leagues this season, should be a boon for Miami.

TheBarcelonastar opened his account from the penalty spot after PSG’s Giovani Lo Celso was brought down in the penalty area.
Messi had to wait until the second half to double Argentina’s lead when he tapped home from close range after the goalkeeper had parried a header from Lo Celso.
And the hat-trick goal arrived eight minutes later when Cristian Pavon pulled the ball back to Messi and he fired powerfully past the goalkeeper.
Messi then set up Sergio Aguero for Argentina’s fourth as they coasted to victory.
The Barcelona star is now below only Pele as the player who has scored the most goals for a South American country.

“The World Cup was a big disappointment for everyone, for him even more so,” he said.

Barcelona will no doubt prefer Messi not to play at all over the international break and get a decent rest instead, but it seems he will feature after returning to the squad.

The question really leads to two possibilities: Messi does not renew his contract and leaves for free, or Messi has renewed already (or will renew) but someone will pay his buyout clause, which reportedly is “just” 300 million euro.
So, has Messi renewed? Well, he hasn’t signed his contract yet. So why did Barça announce it was done?
According to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, the reason is that the physical signing by the player himself is a formality since his father has power of attorney and he has signed already. That is to say, Messi’s own signature is not needed for the contract to be legally valid since the father has signed on.
You can choose to believe Bartomeu or not, but at the moment no one has contradicted him.
However, going along with this version of events still brings up the question: why hasn’t he signed it? Now it could be some mundane scheduling problem, but there’s reason to believe something deeper is at play here.
There are murmurs that Messi is completely dissatisfied with the leadership of the club and is delaying signing the contract because of this. Messi’s contract may be legally valid, but he doesn’t want to give them the photo op and the handshake in public.
And if that’s the case, then the idea of someone paying his buyout (Manchester City perhaps?) and actually forcing the move becomes more believable.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If6Z7ic37Wq3lsbQsWJZNNaX5Zc=/0x0:5000x3327/320x213/filters:focal(1435x1103:2235x1903)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56525239/839598122.1504635932.jpg

Now, there’s no need to be alarmist. Barcelona are a team coming off a disappointing, but certainly not disastrous season. They have a great squad. They have won important trophies recently.

Speaking in an interview with The Athletic, Denis talked about his decision to leaveManchester Cityfor Barça in 2013, although he didn’t get to play for Barça until 2016 after a couple of loan spells inLa Liga.
But having finally landed at the greatest club on Earth, the Spanish international really relished the chance to play (and train) with a couple of all-time greats: Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta.
“I was at City for two years. They wanted me to renew but I preferred to go to Barcelona. Nobody knows what would have happened.
“Maybe if I had stayed, I would be playing regularly there, but I took that decision to go to Barcelona and it was the right one for me because I played a lot of games for their first team.
“And to train with Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta… brutal. Leo is the best. Andres is an example for me. I couldn’t wait to learn from them and play with them, Messi trains how he plays. He loves to win: in every session, he has to win.”

Also, he's anxious for theWorld cupto start."" Those were the reasons given by Argentina's coach Alejandro Sabella for his star man's vomiting problem.
It happened again in the friendly against Slovenia, worryingly for Argentina fans, with the next game no longer a friendly.
""The doctors say it's nothing to worry about,"" Messi's father, Jorge, told AS. ""It does not just happen to him, but to other great athletes in other sports, too.""
""It is a bit about the stress, or a little stomach problem, but there is nothing else. There is no need to give it too much attention,"" he finalized.
Yet, there's been plenty of attention around it. It's impossible not to find analysis on a player that many are already touting as a Golden Boot candidate for the World Cup, which starts today.
Diego Torres, a well-connected if sometimes-controversial Spanish journalist writing forEl Pais, has an insightful explanation. ""The doctors in Argentina andBarcelonaagree,"" he writes. ""The vomiting is psychosomatic.""
In other words, a physical manifestation of immense psychological pressure.
""The demand from a nation that requires the World Cup like it were a right,"" Torres says, ""is just a fraction of the weight he holds up.""
According to Torres, Messi is deeply troubled because he believes his father is responsible for getting him in legal trouble over taxes. The legal trouble is one of the few blemishes to his cherub-like image.
Messi never paid any mind to money and trusted his family to handle it.
Worse, he felt betrayed by the higher-ups in Barcelona. Torres insists that Messi felt they needed to have his back but were nowhere to be seen.
Messi wanted to feel supported, and thus sought to be paid in accordance to the salaries of the world's biggest stars. He wasn't worried about the money per se, but wanted for Barca to show its faith, Torres writes.
He was earning around 30% less than Zlatan Ibrahimovic orWayne Rooney, and was even further away from Cristiano Ronaldo. For the first time, he asked for a raise.
Barcelona did give him that raise, eventually, but they publicly declared it to be Messi's idea, in a move he felt made him look greedy, according to the article.
The article goes on to say that some in the Barca board felt he should be sold while his value was still sky-high, avoiding another drop the likes of which was experienced by another Barcelona superstar, Ronaldinho.
The raise did not seal the wound, because it was never truly about the money. Messi kissed the badge after an amazing performance againstReal Madrid, his way of promising the fans that he cared. But, according to Torres, the relationship with the board is still strained.
For Argentina, Torres reveals that Sabella tends to speak through interpreters, namely Sergio Aguero,Javier Mascherano, and Fernando Gago. No one outside of his inner circle truly understands him.
(Incidentally, that would make the re-signing of Mascherano make even more sense for Barcelona.)
When he arrived at Barcelona, Cesc Fabregas says they thought he was a mute because he never talked. When he was a little boy in Argentina, a girl in class spoke for him to his teachers. It seems little has changed.
The secret to managing Messi, according to Sabella, is simple. ""Don't bust his balls,"" he says.
If Torres's article is accurate, the Barcelona board have done a terrible job of following that mantra.

Messi now plays for Paris Saint-Germain and Argentina, and he could meet Luis Enrique’s Spain the upcoming FIFA World Cup.
“I came back from Argentina after the holidays and we played on January 2 or 3, I don’t remember exactly, and I ended up going to the bench and we had a discussion that lasted a ‘little bit’...” Messi admitted during an interview with formerReal Madridand Argentina great Jorge Valdano.
Messi is probably speaking of a few arguments he had with Luis Enrique in early 2015, when the team was struggling and the manager’s job was called into question.
However, everything changed and the relationship grew stronger. They ended up winning the treble that year, and La Liga and Copa del Rey the next season.
Luis Enrique would resign as coach in his third season, as for the first time, he did not win La Liga. They only won the cup that year.
“We had a spectacular relationship until the last day, when he decided to leave and we told him to stay, not to go, that we were doing well,” Messi said.

Luis Enrique then took a break from coaching before returning as a national team manager. For his part, Messi went through three more coaches at Barcelona before joining PSG. He’s on his second coach in Paris these days.

“Messi is the best player in the history of football. It’s strange to be here and not see him, not to have him on the wing,” he said.

That was the charge levied againstLionel Messifor years. Some still repeat the claim. But under Alejandro Sabella, who has taken over as coach since 2011, it's just not true.
Under Sabella, Messi has scored 21 goals in 25 games, at a truly shocking rate of 0.84 goals per game. Consider that Gabriel Batistuta, Argentina's best ever pure goalscorer, netted at a pace of 0.72 per game. Yet, Messi does a lot more in the game besides score. A more apt comparison may be Diego Maradona's rate of 0.37.
The Rosario native has yet to really find his groove in a big tournament, but in fairness, he's yet to play under Sabella in a big tournament. Messi's scoring rate previous to Sabella was a good but comparatively paltry 0.28.
Messi's deployment under ""The Sloth"" is pretty different than his role at Barcelona. Would Luis Enrique consider having Messi play a similar way when when he starts coaching his first games?
For Argentina, Messi frequently is partnered with Gonzalo Higuain, who takes up a more stationary role upfront. Higuain has three main functions: (1) take up space and distract the opposing defense, (2) score when given chances, and (3) hold up the ball and link play.
Higuain's role is not too dissimilar to his function atReal Madrid, where he used to play until this previous season. He is a born scorer, but despite his impressive scoring record, Los Blancos opted to sell him and keepKarim Benzema.
Benzema does not have quite the same lethal instinct, but he's better at working with his teammates and setting the likes ofCristiano Ronaldoup.
Still, Higuain has worked well with Messi, and they finished 3rd and 2nd, respectively, in the South American qualifiers top scorers chart.
At Barcelona, Messi rarely enjoys this type of partner. Sure, the managers have experimented puttingDavid Villa, Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez, and even Gerard Pique as a ""pivot"" upfront but only in desperate times or other specialized situations. None are really the right fit, either.
There was also the Zlatan Ibrahimovic experiment, but again, lack of link up was a problem.
There are murmurs that Luis Enrique is in the market for a striker that could fit the bill, but so far, nothing has happened. And it's not the first time that such a rumor has surfaced.
What's interesting is that the idea of a more traditional center-forward at Barcelona is seen as a strategy against teams defending deep, but Argentina have become famous for their counter-attack as much as anything.
Messi has played even deeper than he does playing ""false 9"", almost as a traditional attacking midfielder. His direct dribbling and ability to pick a pass with great accuracy make him an asset on the counter-attack, where players typically have more space.
A player such as Higuain - who is a scorer but not selfish, good in the air but mobile - could work. But there is understandably a reluctance to significantly change the makeup of the attack.
On the other hand, there's a good chance thatJavier Mascheranowill return to playing in central midfield next season, the way he does currently for Argentina.
His lack of height is a problem when played as a central defender, which has been his position for the majority of the time at Barca. If the board completes moves for new defenders, and ifMarc Bartracontinues to improve, it would make plenty of sense to shipAlex Songout and deploy Mascherano as a defensive midfielder.
Sabella's Argentina finished their two pre-World Cupfriendlies, and he showed two different formations. One, a lopsided 4-3-3-ish formation, which could be his principal formation. The other, a 3-5-2, could be an alternative. He has yet to show his hand, having missed one key player or another at all times during the friendlies.

Sabella has shown a willingness to be flexible and picked flexible players. In his defenders, he favored players known to play at least two positions. He prized midfielders who worked hard and defended well aside from having good technical ability.
For some time, the World Cup and other international competitions have provided little in the way of tactical innovations. With coaches having little time to drill their players, they have decided to keep it simple.
Could Argentina be an exception? And will Luis Enrique pay any mind?",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dAGVoocvfWLyWyEThkVAgaD75dw=/0x30:521x377/320x213/filters:focal(0x30:521x377)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/34101003/GYI0064089571.0.jpg

Speaking in an interview with The Athletic, Denis talked about his decision to leaveManchester Cityfor Barça in 2013, although he didn’t get to play for Barça until 2016 after a couple of loan spells inLa Liga.
But having finally landed at the greatest club on Earth, the Spanish international really relished the chance to play (and train) with a couple of all-time greats: Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta.
“I was at City for two years. They wanted me to renew but I preferred to go to Barcelona. Nobody knows what would have happened.
“Maybe if I had stayed, I would be playing regularly there, but I took that decision to go to Barcelona and it was the right one for me because I played a lot of games for their first team.
“And to train with Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta… brutal. Leo is the best. Andres is an example for me. I couldn’t wait to learn from them and play with them, Messi trains how he plays. He loves to win: in every session, he has to win.”

Just to clarify, the word “brutal” has a different meaning in Spanish as it does in English: it has mostly a positive conotation, used when someone really wants to convey how good and impressive a certain person or situation is.

”We are wasting a lot of time not having him happy and not being able to give him a hand to achieve that target. I think we are wrong in not being able to help him feel comfortable.
”As a player and as an Argentine I tell him that we need him, that he try to rest, that he keep a cool head and that we need him.

And, to be completely honest, there was this slightest hope deep, deep down that this time around things would be different, that the team would perform better and that the new generation of players called up under Lionel Scaloni would be able to take advantage of having the best player in the world on their team. Yet, that small amount of hope that made me believe, was crushed this Friday with the ugly reality: Argentina and Messi are on different frequencies.
Argentina faced Venezuela in a friendly and from the looks of it, things have gone from bad to worse. The Albicelestes took a 3-1 beating by a team that has never even qualified for aWorld Cupin their country’s history. There was no chemistry between the players and they looked uncomfortable just trying to string several passes together. Youngsters like Pity Martinez and Nicolas Tagliafico failed to link up with Barca’s ‘10’. And the midfield was as slow as traffic on a Monday night in L.A.
The Wanda Metropolitano witnessed another chapter in the disastrous Argentina story. The images from that night with the same old frustrated faces while Leo had his classic serious look glued to his face, refreshed the feelings from the past years of pain. Nothing has changed, absolutely nothing. There might be new faces and a new coach, but not a thing has improved. Argentina continue scratching their heads in confusion, wondering how they can capitalize on the best footballer the world has ever seen.
Leo, more Argentinian than Dulce de Leche
But what strikes me most about this entire situation is the screams regarding Messi’s lack of love and indifference towards his country and his national team. The press have lashed out, labeling Messi a different player with Argentina from the one we see every weekend at Barca. Calling him ‘pecho frio’, and creating this wicked agenda that Messi does not share that same love and passion for his national country like he does for the catalan club. All this constant noise is simply absurd to me. Are we talking about lack of love for a country from a player that keeps coming back for more despite the painful and heartbreaking final defeats? The player that is ready to sacrifice everything to lead his country to some silverware? The player that despite threeCopa Americaheartbreaks and two World Cup tortures is still attracted to come back and give it another try?
Messi keeps coming back for more even when he knows Argentina are not even close to having a stable project planned out. He keeps reappearing in the Albiceleste kit to play football that the team have transformed into a one man job. Eleven players on the pitch, yet only one doing all the work. Even for a player like Messi, who has defined the odds, it’s difficult, not impossible but very difficult. Yet despite all this pressure, ‘Messi-dependency’ and instability within the team, he still comes back for more.
Instead, of labeling it ‘lack of love’, I am convinced Messi has given a new meaning to ‘loving your country’. Through all the pain, sorrow and frustration, Lionel Messi stays true to his beloved Argentina and I just really hope that at end of all this he finally achieves his childhood dream: a trophy with the national team.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBd3CNXGuRzTcDw-U8Oc9T_H5AM=/0x0:4000x2733/320x213/filters:focal(1766x713:2406x1353)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63303930/1137971277.jpg.0.jpg 
https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2011/1/31/1966429/lionel-messi-vs-cristiano-ronaldo-who-will-be-la-ligas-top-scorer,Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo: Who Will Be La Liga's Top Scorer?,38.154.227.167,"Jan 31, 2011","AfterReal Madrid's recent defeat at Osasuna, it seems clear to (almost) everyone that Barcelona will win La Liga once again, for the third consecutive time. Only a very unexpected and disastrous slump could make Barcelona lose the league.
Being the top scorer is not nearly as important as winning the league, but it's still a noteworthy achievement for any player. This season, there seem to be two clear favorites: Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently leads the scoring charts with 22 goals (in 21 matches) and Barcelona's Lionel Messi. The best player in the world has already collected 21 goals in 18 league matches. David Villa is a distant third with 14 goals.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been having a very good season at Real Madrid and he has scored nearly 50% of their goals. He is the reason why Real Madrid are ahead of Villareal in second place. As it stands, the Portuguese star seems to be Real Madrid's only big scoring threat, so it's safe to assume that he'll keep scoring.
Lionel Messi was the best scorer last season with 34 goals, but it's going to be very difficult for him to do it again. He might be a more dangerous scorer than Cristiano Ronaldo, but he has mostly been playing behind Pedro and Villa, as a false 9. His great vision makes him the current leader of the assist charts, with a huge advantage. But of course this is Lionel Messi we're talking about here, hands down the most talented player of the current generation. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Argentine ended the season at the top of both the scoring and the assist charts. Right now, he's only one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo and leads the assist charts, with a five-assist advantage over the second, Daniel Alves. It'll be diffcult to top both, but you can expect everything from Messi.
What seems clear is that it will be a two horse race between Messi and Ronaldo to see who the top scorer will be. However, David Villa can't be completely ignored; if he goes on a good scoring run, he might eventually close down on Messi and Ronaldo. But as long as he's on the same team as Messi, the Argentine will be the main scorer, which makes it very difficult for Villa to be the pichichi.
Messi is very likely to win La Liga with Barcelona again and to capture his third straigth Ballon d'Or, but the pichichi award and the Golden Boot are a different story, as the best player in the world faces stiff competition from Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.
But knowing Messi, it's now the pichichi that he's after, it's glory for Barcelona. He has shown time and again that he doesn't care how many goals he scores, as long as Barcelona win. His assist record speaks for itself.  This season, Messi has already scored 37 goals and assisted 18 (21 and 14 in La Liga) in only 32 matches!
La Liga is full of brilliant players, like his teammates Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro and Villa, or Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. These are all among the best players in the world, but Messi is a supernova that outshines them all. He's truly a once in a generation player and a blessing to all Barcelona supporters!

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2013/1/6/3841784/why-lionel-messi-should-win-the-2012-fifa-ballon-dor,Why Lionel Messi Should Win The FIFA Ballon d'Or,185.199.229.156,"Jan  6, 2013","It is yet again that time of the year when the football community is merely counting the hours to when the prize for the best footballer in the world will be given. The long list of nominees has been chopped down to three: two men have Blaugrana blood running in their veins while the other leads the line for arguably the most successful European club. Obviously different people might have different views all over the world about who they view as the best footballer and the criteria they use but nobody will deny thatCristiano Ronaldo, Andres Iniesta andLionel Messideserve to be the in the final shortlist for their performance over the previous season and it is hereby argued that only the latter deserves to walk away with the accolade.

After losing to the Portuguese superstar in 2008 Messi's retaliation was not to be the eye-for-an-eye kind of a thing; he's already taken three eyes if we continue with the metaphor, and he does not seem to be slowing down. Being a holder of the joint record of three awards, Messi could even go on to double that number, his current run of form and consistence strengthens his case and at 25, age is definitely on his side.
Individually, La Pulga had an enormous season. His stats in the previous campaign compete with those of some European teams in the big 5 leagues. With his goal scoring ability, one might easily mistake his ruthlesness in front of goal for selfishness but that is not the case at all; Messi creates a lot of goals for teammates too, in fact most teams would gobble at the opportunity to sign a playmaker of his calibre in their ranks.
Records (2011/2012)
Further Records (2012)
2011/2012 Team Accolades
Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona missed out on the two biggest trophies in the previous campaign, bowing out in the semi finals of the Champions League to eventual winners Chelsea as well as finishing second in La Liga behind Cristiano'sReal Madrid. Nonetheless the team did pile-up the rest of the trophies on offer; winning theSpanish Supercopa, theEuropean Supercup, theClub World Cupas well as theCopa del Rey.
Barcelona's poor consistency in away league matches cost them the League as their season's success boiled down to two crucial games against Chelsea and Madrid, games they lost, so with that in mind;Why exactly does Leo deserve it more than the other two you might ask.Well I will tell you why:
1. For starters, the accolades some of us are counting against Messi are purely ""Team"" awards. If we are comparing Barcelona to Madrid or to Chelsea it's fine because that's what team awards are good for. Nobody ""single-handedly"" wins trophies, at least not in football. A minimum of ten other men (plus substitutes) run their socks off to help get their team the result; it's not a one man kind of a thing. Managers, directors, team doctors and even club presidents occationally take some of the credit when the team wins and deservedly so. It is a team because the many individuals in it work together for a common goal; the defence trying to keep out goals, the offence trying to get them, subs coming in to relieve tired teammates and bring fresh blood just to make sure their team maintains a lead or fight for a comeback. EvenPepe Reinaand Victor Valdes won Euro and World Cup medals for being part of a ""team"" that performed well even though their contributions might have been minimum at best, and there are a lot more footballers who won even more trophies across Europe and the World, they don't go around taking all their teammates' credit for a team performance.
2. Messi had an incredible ""individual"" season in all competitions. He boasts numbers most winners of the award have never thought possible. He's broken records after records and some were his own. Scoring 73 goals is no child's play, it takes serious determination. Top scorer in the Champions League as well as in La Liga, I'm sure if it was that simple to score we would have at least 5 players walking around boasting their 50 goals in a season, but it's not.
Messi had no consistant teammate to score goals when he couldn't, unlike his rival from the capital club who did.David Villa, who was already showing a major dip in form, got injured last season. Alexis Sanchez was visiting the treatment table almost every month and even then, Alexis and Pedro Rodriguez were so bad (in front of goal) last season that you'd be sure they'd still hit a stationary goalkeeper with the ball, or miss him in preference for the frame of the goal. This meant that almost all of Barca's attacks relied solely on Messi's boots for the finish and the numbers speak for themselves, but at the end of the day it's a team sport and even HE can't score for 100 percent of the games. Once in a while a team will come with a plan to keep him at bay and it is at that time when offensive teammates need to come to his (and the team's) aid. Just for the sake of comparison; Ronaldo had both his striker friends racking over 20 goals. In fact if Gonzalo Higuain was the penalty taker at Madrid, he could easily have finished the season with numbers similar to those of Cristiano's. Madrid was more consistent than Barcelona because when their superstar couldn't get the goal, someone else did. This is of course admittedly this author's opinion and other reasons might have accounted for Messi's Barcelona losing the league.
The game against Chelsea is a practical example of what's already been said about having teammates who occasionally leave their scoring boots at home. The English club had ten men congested in the middle who effectively marked Messi out of the game, or at least where he likes to play; that and the fact that Cech was in scintillating form. His winger teammates couldn't help break the deadlock either and when he missed that penalty, the big trophy with the ears was not to be. That's exactly what happened, an excellent run of form by Messi and Barcelona that had Bookmakers sure they would retain the trophy all came crumbling down because he could not get the goal and nobody else could.
All teams lose at some point and players know that better that anyone, which is why when the season starts players just want to do really well, taking it game by game and winning as much as possible and also hoping (for the team) that the day they lose, it will not be a season destroying loss. Messi did the same for the team as an individual in 2011-2012, he started the season scoring as much goals as he possibly could to help the team and help the team he did.
One should not mistaken his incredible scoring records for selfishness either, because you need not go far but look at his assists statistics to be convinced that he does indeed lookout for his teammates.
With his incredible scoring stats from the previous campaign as a striker/playmaker dwarfing those of rivals Iniesta and Ronaldo, Messi will and should win the upcoming Ballon d'Or award for the record 4thtime. With his goals so far this season, make no mistake because he'll still be part of the final shortlist next year.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjN6vbTqJbXM8LnsJZfjAwa3RZI=/0x58:4000x2725/320x213/filters:focal(0x58:4000x2725)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/6131533/157273130.0.jpg

Messi offered his thoughts on the win and being back with the national team after the game.
“It was a complicated year for what we are living through,”he said.
“Being able to go back and play with the Argentina national team and give happiness to people with the win, beyond the game, serves to decompress. Much strength to all Argentines.

“What a privilege to have been able to share these 9 seasons together. What beautiful experiences we have enjoyed and how we have overcome difficult moments.

Ronaldo deservedly wins the award after leadingReal Madridto their tenth UEFA Champions League title, Ronaldo's second personal European trophy. And CR7 won it in spectacular fashion, setting the record for most goals ever scored in a single edition of the tournament, with an astonishing mark of 17 goals in 11 appearances, a truly great accomplishment for the Portuguese star.
Winning the UCL was a good enough argument for Ronaldo to take the Golden Ball home, but that wasn't just what he did. CR7 had the best year of his career, scoring a whopping 61 goals in 60 appearances, while also finishing with 22 total assists for club and country.
Manuel Neuer also had a great case to win the Ballon D'Or, winning theWorld Cupwith a fantastic set of performances as a sweeper-keeper. The German star didn't only play great in Brazil, but he providedBayern Munichwith spectacular game after spectacular game, and separated himself from the rest, and was established as the best goalkeeper on the planet.
Finally, there's Lionel Messi. TheBarcelonasuperstar had allegedly a ""down year"" in his career, his first season ever as a professional without winning a championship. But he was still able to score 58 goals and dish out 21 assists in 66 appearances this year for club and country. His performances for Argentina in the World Cup were good enough to give him the Golden Ball for best player in the competition. However, the lack of trophies definitely hurt his case for the Ballon D'Or.
Congrats to Ronaldo. He deserves it.

According to the Italian defender, there is an efficient way to defend againstReal MadridstrikerCristiano Ronaldo.
""In the last few years the role of the defender has been re-evaluated. Everyone has to be good at understanding their role. Experience helps you to read certain situations better and make less mistakes in terms of behaviour. Knowledge of the opponent is essential, too, individually as well as the team.

I will not argue with Chiellini, and he makes a very good point. Ronaldo's days as a two-foot monster goalscorer are over, and he is clearly preferring to go with his right, so forcing him left is a good idea.

“It is difficult to imagine Messi outside the club. He is the most important player in the history of Barcelona. He has been a very important piece, if not the most important. Beyond the friendship I have with him, I would have been sorry if he left badly,” he said.
“At times like this, I’m not interested in bothering Messi. I spoke and expressed my support, but neither by investigating too much. I talk with him often, I let him know that it was a joy for me that he stayed.”

The captain’s contract expires at the end of the campaign and it’s not known yet what he plans to do next.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Q0Y14deBUjL8lIDt7UfuIzRRNc=/0x0:3875x2684/320x213/filters:focal(1600x667:2220x1287)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67453559/856397094.jpg.0.jpg

Only a very unexpected and disastrous slump could make Barcelona lose the league.
Being the top scorer is not nearly as important as winning the league, but it's still a noteworthy achievement for any player. This season, there seem to be two clear favorites: Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently leads the scoring charts with 22 goals (in 21 matches) and Barcelona's Lionel Messi. The best player in the world has already collected 21 goals in 18 league matches. David Villa is a distant third with 14 goals.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been having a very good season at Real Madrid and he has scored nearly 50% of their goals. He is the reason why Real Madrid are ahead of Villareal in second place. As it stands, the Portuguese star seems to be Real Madrid's only big scoring threat, so it's safe to assume that he'll keep scoring.
Lionel Messi was the best scorer last season with 34 goals, but it's going to be very difficult for him to do it again. He might be a more dangerous scorer than Cristiano Ronaldo, but he has mostly been playing behind Pedro and Villa, as a false 9. His great vision makes him the current leader of the assist charts, with a huge advantage. But of course this is Lionel Messi we're talking about here, hands down the most talented player of the current generation. It wouldn't be a surprise if the Argentine ended the season at the top of both the scoring and the assist charts. Right now, he's only one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo and leads the assist charts, with a five-assist advantage over the second, Daniel Alves. It'll be diffcult to top both, but you can expect everything from Messi.
What seems clear is that it will be a two horse race between Messi and Ronaldo to see who the top scorer will be. However, David Villa can't be completely ignored; if he goes on a good scoring run, he might eventually close down on Messi and Ronaldo. But as long as he's on the same team as Messi, the Argentine will be the main scorer, which makes it very difficult for Villa to be the pichichi.
Messi is very likely to win La Liga with Barcelona again and to capture his third straigth Ballon d'Or, but the pichichi award and the Golden Boot are a different story, as the best player in the world faces stiff competition from Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo.
But knowing Messi, it's now the pichichi that he's after, it's glory for Barcelona. He has shown time and again that he doesn't care how many goals he scores, as long as Barcelona win. His assist record speaks for itself.  This season, Messi has already scored 37 goals and assisted 18 (21 and 14 in La Liga) in only 32 matches!
La Liga is full of brilliant players, like his teammates Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro and Villa, or Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo. These are all among the best players in the world, but Messi is a supernova that outshines them all. He's truly a once in a generation player and a blessing to all Barcelona supporters!

“Ronaldinho is at the level of the best, perhaps what he lacked was consistency. Perhaps he lacked consistency when at his peak.
“For me only Messi is above Ronaldinho because of the consistency of the last few years,” he said.
“Messi is the best in history, but Ronaldinho is with the best. The rest follow. He (Ronaldinho) is with the best: with Ronaldo Fenômeno, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, that group.”

Speaking in today’s pre-match press conference, Enrique weighed in on a number of topics but the big headline surrounds Luis Suarez and his upcoming debut.
Of course, while Suarez will feature tomorrow, the Uruguayan forward will not be available for next weekend’s La Liga opener against Elche; in fact, as the Court of Arbitration for Sport did not completely overturn his ban, Suarez will not feature again in a Blaugrana jersey until the end of October. In that sense, tomorrow’s token debut can only be viewed as a political gesture, but it will be encouraging to see how Suarez fits in nonetheless given the frenzy that accompanied his arrival in Catalunya.
However, while Suarez may steal the headlines, Lucho gave us more good news, confirming that – against all the odds – Neymar will be given the medical green light prior to tomorrow’s friendly and that the Brazilian may too feature in the Barça attack.
Previous estimates had ruled Neymar out of the start of the season following Juan Zuniga’s horror challenge in the FIFA World Cup quarter-final, but the Brazilian boy wonder has been training with the squad for the best part of a week and may now be in contention for a starting berth against Elche. In addition, club captain Xavi Hernández is also expected to receive the medical green light tomorrow and will be with the squad for the start of the campaign after recovering from a calf injury sustained against OGC Nice.
WithLionel Messiexpected to feature for the first time this preseason, Luis Enrique kept his cards close to his chest, refusing to confirm or deny that Suarez, Messi and Neymar will feature together against Club Leon tomorrow.

Messi has not been called up for friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September. Reports have claimed he will make a decision on his international future next year.
Scaloni has taken temporary charge of La Albiceleste following the departure of Jorge Sampaoli and spoke briefly about Messi at his first press conference as coach.
“I know you are all waiting for me to talk about him, so that is the only specific issue I will cover: we had a chat, after which we decided he would not be there,” he said.
”It would be very unwise of me to tell Leo to stay at home and not come. There is no coach in the world who would benefit from Leo not being available.
”We did not talk about his future. He will not be in this call-up and we will see what happens in the next ones.”

Rajoub had previously said photos and shirts of theBarcelonastar should be burned if the match went ahead.
It’s unclear if Lionel Messi had any role in the decision. Argentina’s foreign minister, Jorge Faurie, said “the players of the national team were not willing to play the game,” but he did not say which players or why they had misgivings about the match.
Forward Gonzalo Higuaín said “in the end, we were able to do the right thing. It’s in the past now. The first thing is health and common sense. We think the right thing to do was not to go.”
Argentine FA President Claudio Tapia said the match was cancelled for security reasons. “My responsibility,” he said, “is the health and safety of the Argentine delegation.”
“I would like that, starting now,” Tapia went on to say, “everyone takes my decision [to cancel the Israel match] as a contribution to world peace.”
Argentina manager Jorge Sampaoli had refused to be drawn into a comment about the security or political situation, but he did say he preferred not to travel to Israel for sporting reasons.
Rajoub said the Palestinian protest against the match only happened when the Israelis decided to “turn it into a political event” by moving the game from Haifa to Jerusalem.

They both were able to continue, however.
Still, there was some concern about Messi’s ankle after the match, as it was clearly hurt. The Argentine went to the club’s training facilities on his day off to work on his injury with the doctors.

For culés, the footballing impact has not quite set in. For years, Lionel Messi’s heroics have bailed a declining Barça, and have allowed Bartomeu to make shady deals that make little sporting sense.
Without Leo, though, this veneer will be peeled off. No longer can Barça continue to rely on 50+ goals and assists from one source, and need to rebuild into a more collective effort. The offensive hole that Messi will leave cannot be understated. He isBarcelona’s attack, and without him the free-flowing attacking will be hard to replicate. Barça are in a unique position in world football. No other club is quite so reliant on a singular source for goal creation, and therefore, there isn’t really a point of reference. This really is uncharted territory. This is not to say thatAntoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembélé and Ansu Fati won’t put in a shift. It’s the magnitude of the shift required that is worrying, in and of itself.
It may sound surreal to say this but the on-field impacts of this departure are fairly obvious. What is perhaps more understated is the commercial and political implication of Messi’s departure. The Messi brand rakes in millions for Barcelona, and compensating for this will take years of rebranding and commercialization of unrealised assets. This may mean pushing Griezmann, Frenkie de Jong and Marc-Andre ter Stegen to the fore while signing certain big-name players as well. It won’t be easy, mind you. The Messi brand is one of the most lucrative in the world. It is a commercial venture yes, but it is also a cult of personality, a moot point, an immediate identifier. Messi is a massive draw for casuals and those who belong to non-footballing families, a way to draw in ambiguous viewers. A way to cement Barça as a global entity.
Without his presence, the way to bridge that gap is unclear. Will the club use a multi-pronged rebranding? Will they attempt to push forward the youth? Make it into a more holistic endeavour. With Bartomeu at the helm? That is unlikely. Whatever way they choose, however, they have to act fast. The Barcelona brand, without a proper contingency plan, will decline fast. For Bartomeu and company, who often use their monetary exploits as a sign of progress, this would be disastrous.
Perhaps, disaster wouldn’t be the worst thing, as it stands.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PupJFxKmsLxaY7P6USUBWAU1Ap0=/0x0:2279x3000/320x213/filters:focal(1052x666:1416x1030)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67343461/1266339699.jpg.0.jpg

”We broke their defensive line well in the first half. They wanted to reduce the space inside, but the room was behind their defence and that’s where the first goal came from.
”In the second half we were more tired, we didn’t have the ball as much and we wanted to play very fast.”

“The anti-Messi plan will be rather collective, where we will all have to respond. We will have to strengthen the midfield and the pressure around Messi,” he said.
“If you do individual marking to a man like him, at some point it will make a difference. And then, there is another aspect. We must defend well, when we do not have possession of the ball.”

Silky smooth from start to finish, it’s no wonder that Lionel Messi’s goal againstSevillahad the whole of the Camp Nou - bar the Sevillistas - on their feet.
TV cameras picked up on the away fans with a look that said ‘how on earth do you defend againstthat?!’
The brush strokes of masters at work, it was a joy to watch the move unfolding. What’s particularly pleasing, aside from the move and goal itself, is that it came in the 90th minute when Barca were already 5-1 up.
No let up in intensity until the final whistle. Magical.

From the moment that the Blaugranes cleared their lines and Carles Alena moved forward with considerable purpose, you could sense that the move could develop into something special. Particularly as most of the away side had been caught upfield.
As Messi took the ball from the youngster, Sevilla only had four players in their own half with others struggling to make up the ground.
With an overload on the opposite flank, it was the perfect moment for Messi to deliver one of those crossfield passes to feet that he manages with military precision.
Almost cut out by the covering defender, that’s the nearest any Sevilla player would get to the ball. In the next few seconds, we were mesmerised by the Barca of old. The Barca that we know and love. The Barca that has regularly been missing under Ernesto Valverde.
The shackles were off.

WhenBarcelonaplay football like that, they still truly have no equal. Setting standards that others can only aspire to.
It underscored a great night’s work which began with a penalty from the much-maligned Philippe Coutinho.

At the same time, Messi also reached 500 games in La Liga. That puts him just five away from Xavi’s record in the league.
Among his 750 matches are 524 wins, 138 draws, and 88 losses. He’s scored 644 goals in that time, which is not only a club record, but a record for any player scoring for a single club.

It's been an interesting season for the undisputed best player in the world. With the emergence of Luis Suarez as the team's leading goal threat, Messi has become more of a provider.  He's become the team's primary set piece taker and is usually responsible for most of the direct free kick opportunities. Some absolutely beautiful goals have come as a result this season.

Exhibit C:
However, Messi is not satisfied with his seven free kick goals so far this season. He told ESPN that he's practicing every day to get better and perfect his technique.
""I've been doing extra free kick training for a while now. I'm practicing every time I can.""
He also has a message for any of the doubters out there that believe his free kick goals are a product of luck or some other factors. Messi proclaims that the years and years of practice have given him some insight on how to trick goalkeepers and beat them.
""Yes, the truth is that we train for this; we work on how to move so that the ball goes to the right place and also you learn things over the course of your career.""
The trick to being consistent, he says, is to keep the goalkeeper guessing and never be predictable.
""Yes. To be honest, I like to hit the ball over the players' wall but from time to time I like to mix it up a little bit so that the goalkeeper doesn't know where I'm going and I want to keep him confused until I kick. I think for that reason I like to keep the goalkeeper in doubt.""

It's hard to imagine Messi getting anymore precise and deadly from his set piece opportunities but we won't put it past him to accomplish his goal. As he gets older he'll have to adjust and find new ways to score goals. Perhaps becoming a free kick specialist is his answer to solving that future problem.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d6VvgyhxGDSBOc7KZFqbjkJQ2Iw=/0x0:3000x1998/320x213/filters:focal(1976x932:2456x1412)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49558681/530297926.0.jpg

Unless you've living been on Mars or under a rock for the past five years, you've certainly heard of Lionel Messi: the most talented player of the current generation of footballers and a player whom many tip to become Maradona's heir as the best player of all-time.
Messi might be only 23, but these expectations are more than legitimate: Messi brought them upon himself. The Argentine genuis has been marvelling football fans worldwide ever since he became a full-time pro. In fact, Messi has been in the Fifa Player of the Year top 20 in each of his full years as a pro player: 20th in 2006, second in 2007 and 2008 and winner in 2009. This year, he is a top contender for the award once again, even though Xavi and Iniesta are more likely to take in theory. To sum up, Messi has ALWAYS been at the top.
To make matters even more impressive, 2007 and 2008 years were trophiless years for Barcelona and low-scoring, injury-plagued years for Messi. Still, he managed to be second in the FIFA award on both occasions, nearly beating Cristiano Ronaldo (who had had the best seasn of his life) in the 2008 race. Just imagine if Messi hadn't picked up so many injuries or if Barcelona had picked up silverware... Messi would probably have two more Golden Balls in his pocket by now(he'll certainly get many more in his career, though).
If Messi was already arguably the best in the world, Guardiola's appointment as Barcelona's manager took his game to a whole new level. Guardiola & Leo was truly a match made in heaven. Under Pep, Messi has scored a disbelieving 102 goals, along with 38 assists, in 119 matches. He has basically created 140 goals in 119 matches!

In 2008/2009, he was part of one of the best attacking trios ever with Thiery Henry and Samuel Eto'o. He led the team in scoring with 38 goals and assisted 18 as he led Barcelona to a glorious season and an unprecedented sextuple!
In 2009/2010, with Eto'o gone, Henry dipping in form and Ibrahimovic proving to be a flop, Barcelona became even more reliant on Messi for goals and Leo stepped up, scoring 47 goals in all competitions, thus equaling Ronaldo's record set on 1996/1997 (which is impressive, considering that, unlike the Brazilian, Messi isn't an out-an-out striker).
This season, despite an early injury, he already has 17 goals and six assists in only 15 matches, and the best might be yet to come. His own 47-goal record might actually be beaten by Messi this season.
We can't forget that Messi is only 23 and can only improve. He's a better, more complete today than he was a year ago. His passing, his playmaking skills, his free-kicks, his goalscoring instincts... he has been improving on every aspect of his game, making fans believe that by the time he reaches his peak he might become the best and most complete player in history.
It's still too soon to make such a statement, but there's no doubt that Messi is on the right path. During these five years as a pro, he has always mantained a very high level, but some of his performances have just been otherwordly. In 2006, still a teenager, Messi scored a hat trick in El Classico at Camp Nou to salvage a 3-3 draw. That performance confirmed what everyone at Barcelona knew since Messi was just a youth player: Leo really is a very special player.
In the past two seasons, under Pep Guardiola, setting the world on fire has become a routine for Messi. Among many otherwordly performances, his four goals against Arsenal at Camp Nou in last season's quarter-finals of the Champions League is perhaps the most famous. After that match, pundits all around the world started discussing Messi's place among the all-time greats and comparisons with Maradona became even more regular. On the receiving end of the Messi show, Arsène Wenger was forced to hail Lionel Messi as the best player of this generation.
Right now, there's no doubt that Messi is the best in the world by a very large distance. From Arsène Wenger to Arjen Robben, everyone in the football world acknowleges Messi's unmatched talents. The challenge for Messi is to keep motivated despite the absence of rivals (given Messi's love for football and for the club, it's safe to assume that he will) and work his way to eternal greatness.
Having achieved almost everything with Barcelona, his challenge now will be to lead Argentina to glory, while doing the same with Barcelona. At 23 years old, the sky is the limit for Lionel Messi! Let's hope he reaches it...

“I will always be grateful to Messi the human - funny and sentimental - because everyone knows the player.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2011/2/23/2003245/getting-to-know-lionel-messi,Getting To Know: Lionel Messi,45.155.68.129,"Feb 23, 2011","Full name: Lionel Andrés MessiSquad No: 10Position: ForwardDate of birth: 24 June 1987Place of birth: Rosario, ArgentinaHeight: 1.69 m (5 ft 7 in)Weight: 67 kg (148 lbs)
Lionel Messi was born into a working class family in the city of Rasario in the Santa Fe province. He started playing football at the age of five for Grandoli, a local club coached by his father. In 1995 he joined the Newell's Old Boys, the biggest club of his hometown.
Three years later he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, a disease, that according to analysis of doctors from River Plate, a team interested in his services, he would not grow taller that 1.40m (4ft 7in) unless treated properly. River plate were willing to sign the exciting youngster, but they couldn't cover his medical expenses, a bill of $900 a month, an amount that even his parents weren't able to pay.
When he turned 13, Leo and his father, Jorge, traveled to their relatives in Barcelona and while there, they were able to set up a meeting with Carles Rexach, the technical director of FC Barcelona. He was immediately impressed with Messi's abilities. They signed the contract on a paper napkin, offering to pay the medical expenses if Messi was willing to move to Barcelona. The whole family then moved to Spain and Messi made spectacular progress through Barcelona's youth teams and joined Barcelona C, B and the first team in record time. His skills were so impressive that he only played in 22 games for the B team before he was called up. He scored six goals in the short stint with the second team.
La Pulga'sofficial debut for the first team came in the league against Espanyol at the age of 17 years and 114 days and broke the record for the youngest player to play for Barcelona in the league. He went on to brake several youth related records, but since then all of them have been broken by fellow youngster Bojan. With many players out injured, he became a starter and played on the wing. The following season Messi established himself as a regular first team player and he was having a very good year until he suffered a season ending thigh injury.
Messi made a full recovery and the next season he started to make a name for himself, especially with the hat-trick against Real Madrid. He was on the fast track to become one of the best players in the world and he was still only 20 years old. He became a regular recipient of different awards and a constant in the top three of the World Player of the Year awards. He is considered as the best player in the world and despite the fact that every season he seems to brake new records, he always has another gear left in case the team needs something more. So far, in his brilliant career, he has made 249 appearances for the first team of FC Barcelona during which he scored 167 goals and assisted on another 69 of them.
Just as in the world of club football, Messi became a feature in club very early in his career, he made his debut for the U-20 team in 2004, as still just a 16 year old. He was an integral part of the  U-20 World Cup winning team in 2005. Leo made his senior debut already at the age of 18 and has been a starter since then. He has appeared in 54 games, scored 16 goals and assisted on 10 forLa Albiceleste.
ProfileLionel Messi is an unique player. He has been able to overcome his height problems and develop ball skills that are second to none. He's a quick, extremely balanced and versatile player that can play in the midfield, on either wing or even as a striker. Messi possesses a lethal touch with his natural left foot, but he is also a  strong finisher with his right. He has tremendous vision, but he often tries to finish the play himself instead of searching for teammates in a better position. Messi is also a specialist of dead ball situations, especially penalty kicks and free kicks from the right side.

The lack of scuttlebutt around a PSG extension or a move to Saudi Arabia have left those at the club convinced Messi desires a return to the club.
What remains is Barcelona figuring out their financial difficulties to the point wherein Messi can return without setting off fire alarms everywhere. President Joan Laporta also needs to mend fences with Messi should he hope for a smooth transition.
Team-mates getting the feeling that Messi wants a return isn’t surprising. Messi wines and dines with a good number of players on the Barca roster so they would get a sense of his desires. Let’s just hope the bosses and finance department can make some magic happen.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qmVM31luz2XHxqMsronzb4gaAoE=/0x0:2201x1467/320x213/filters:focal(925x558:1277x910)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/72191858/1232931689.0.jpg 
https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2015/3/8/8170789/lionel-messi-editorial,"No matter what, Messi will always be taken for granted",45.94.47.66,"Mar  8, 2015","You know when you get married for the first time, and the first six months are awesome? It's all new, you do everything together, you go eat at different places, you want to be with the other person all the time, and it's all love and fun. And that love and fun don't seem to disappear at all.
But then, routine happens. You see her all the time, you have to eat the same bad dinner she cooked every night, you think she just wants to spend your money going to the mall every weekend, you don't see movies together anymore, you look to go out with your friends just to get that crappy marriage out of your mind. And eventually, things aren't fun anymore. Love runs out, and you're stuck. You ask yourself, ""do I even love her anymore?"" You took things for granted, the marriage got bad and you never realized it. You're not happy, and all of a sudden it's over.
Once in a while, that metaphor comes to my mind when I think aboutBarcelona(and football) fans andLionel Messi. The relationship started in an amazing way, and we all loved to witness his greatness. We just watched in awe as he blitzed the sport and became one of the best players in history. Every Messi game wasn't just must-watch, it was can't-miss. You just say to yourself ""MESSI IS PLAYING! I HAVE TO SEE IT!""
Seeing him win with Pep Guardiola was awesome. He did things we never thought was possible, and he made us smile with every new trophy he lifted while doing impossible and beautiful things.
But as time went on, we started to take Messi for granted. Even though he was still doing Lio Stuff, we just weren't appreciating him as we should. Especially after Barça started losing with Tata Martino. Even Barcelona fans were saying he was in decline, and maybe the Messi Era has just become part of the past.
And then came this season, and Leo doesn't like his coach, he doesn't like being moved back to the right flank and he's not happy. And his season is probably going to confirm to everybody that Messi is simply not the same and we're going to see a shadow of his former self.
But, as always, Leo did his talk on the field. And after five months of REAL high-level football, we have to recognize that we were all wrong about him. I don't care what you say, at some point you questioned your trust on Messi. It's just that simple. Your marriage became routine. And you knew that things weren't the same, but you don't know what happened. You took the marriage for granted, and all of a sudden you're questioning whether or not this is good for you.
We've all taken Messi for granted. We are still going to take Messi for granted. He's just SO FAWKING GOOD that his greatness becomes routine. It shouldn't be. We are witnessing something historic every single time we watch a Messi match. But sometimes we just forget about it.
One thing we should never, EVER, forget: Lionel Messi is just the best wife ever.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2016/11/21/13698350/the-answer-for-paco-alcacer-lionel-messi,The Answer for Paco Alcácer: Lionel Messi?,188.74.210.21,"Nov 21, 2016","Paco Alcácer had a shocking outing as a starter for FC Barcelona’s 0-0 draw with Málaga. It’s not just that he didn’t score, yet again, it’s that yet again, he looked lost. He rarely touched the ball and didn’t make the kind of runs that made teammates find him. Arguably, Gerard Piqué was a more effective centerforward than him when the big man left his spot in defense to play upfront.
While there’s no doubt that Alcácer has a lot to answer for given this performance, as well as the whole season so far, there is one excuse that he can legitimately point to.
Alcácer has not played much at all with Lionel Messi. In nine games, Alcácer has only played alongside the Argentine star for 81 minutes, sprinkled in a few different games.
Now, it’s true that Alcácer should be good enough not to rely on any one player to help him get to the correct level, but perhaps what he needs is an outing alongside the best in the world to get him back in form.
Messi attracts double, triple, quadruple and quintuple coverage and is a master assist maker. This is exactly what Alcácer could use given his horrid run of form.
Of course, it’s far from a cure-all. Unless Alcácer gets his stuff in order, he’s never going to dig himself out of the hole. His inability to figure out his role in the system this far into the season is worrying, to say the least.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFzhmYtFZKTEahIySfdgH0moJoQ=/0x0:5000x3434/320x213/filters:focal(2048x681:2848x1481)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51933521/610111782.0.jpeg

And one world-class defender is aware of that.
Juventuscenter-backGiorgio Chiellini, one of the world's best at his position, gave a nice interview toEurosport Italia, and one of the topics discussed was his strategies to mark some of football's best attackers. According to the Italian defender, there is an efficient way to defend againstReal MadridstrikerCristiano Ronaldo.
""In the last few years the role of the defender has been re-evaluated. Everyone has to be good at understanding their role. Experience helps you to read certain situations better and make less mistakes in terms of behaviour. Knowledge of the opponent is essential, too, individually as well as the team. How do you mark Cristiano Ronaldo? You try not to leave him alone, don’t let him shoot on his right foot.""

I will not argue with Chiellini, and he makes a very good point. Ronaldo's days as a two-foot monster goalscorer are over, and he is clearly preferring to go with his right, so forcing him left is a good idea.
But what about Messi, Giorgio? What's your tip on how to defend the Argentine as one of the best in the world at marking?

Apparently, the thoughts of how to stop Lionel Messi hit Van Dijk pretty quickly because he was asked about it after the match and already had some thoughts.
“How are we going to do it (stop Messi)? I don’t know, we’ll see. It’s going to be a great match-up for all of us,” he said.
“It’s about doing it all together, it’s never 1vs1, it’s never just me against a particular striker. It’s always us against everyone and I think that’s the only way we can defend well.

A loss toReal Sociedad, combined with the revelation of deep issues between the club's biggest star,Lionel Messi, and coachLuis Enrique, have created a tough environment for the team.
So a few people decided to take action. First, it was president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who fired former Director of Football Andoni Zubizarreta. A few hours later,Carles Puyolresigned as Zubi's assistant after just four months at the job. Enrique is now on the hot seat, being blamed for most of the locker room issues and has his job in jeopardy, something that seemed impossible just two weeks ago.
Now, the players are doing something about it. Diario Sport is reporting that Messi will have a meeting with the rest of the captains (Xavi, Iniesta and Busquets). They want to hear Leo's side of the story and find out why does Messi have such a big problem with Lucho. The captains have already talked to Enrique about the issue.
After hearing from Messi, the group plans to have a meeting between players and Enrique only, to solve the situation and move on from the issue, sources say.
This crisis has resurrected the rumors about a possible Messi departure, with Chelsea being the favorites to land the best player in the world. The rumors got stronger after Leo startedfollowing the London club and a few players on Instagram, which somehow means that he's made up his mind and he's going to England just because he's looking at photos from Chelsea people.
If there's one area where Barcelona have not been good at with this issue, it's office politics. The team captains will try to clean up the mess. Maybe it's too late.

It remains to be seen if Messi will play on Tuesday although there obviously there’s no point whatsoever in risking him.
We should get an update before Tuesday’s game but at the moment Messi seems to be a real doubt for the game.

There’s a report from ESPN’s Samuel Marsden that it remains “unlikely” for him to play. The captain came off in the second half of this past weekend’s win over Granada.
There hasn’t been an official statement from Barcelona in regards to the severity or simply details around Messi’s injury. Which, despite the hopefully insignificant nature of the injury, is still a bit concerning and annoying.
Messi had been in good form as of late, scoring four times in his last two matches. Let’s hope the injury isn’t that serious and sitting out for a week or two is enough.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2012/8/15/3242689/fc-barcelona-2011-12-season-in-review-lionel-messi,FC Barcelona 2011/12 Season in Review: Lionel Messi,188.74.210.207,"Aug 15, 2012","Report:Can anything more be said that hasn't been said before aboutLionel Messi? Probably not but I still have to try to review yet another record breaking season by the little Argentine.
Even a player that appears to play every game in every season can set a career high in appearances. Messi featured in an absolutely amazing 60 games for Barcelona in the season (and he also added ten appearances with the Argentinian national team) and it appeared that in every single game he played he set a new record. While that last statement is an exaggeration it is not by much.
At the very beginning of the season you knew this season was going to be something special as in the 5-4 aggregate win over Real Madrid in the Supercopa de España Messi scored three goals and assisted on the other two and then went on to score the game winner in the UEFA Super Cup.
Soon after the La Liga season began Messi surpassed László Kubala to become Barça's second highest scorer in official competitions. But that milestone simply marked the begging of the chase for first place and César Rodríguez - a record Messi would break just months later. Messi also scored in all six completions he appeared in before the calendar said 2012.
He scored more goals than anybody ever did in European football (73) and scored more league goals than anybody in the history of all European League competitions (50). Messi broke the record for most goals in a single Champions League season (14) and became the only player to ever score five goals in Europe's most important competition. Messi also equaled Barça records for scoring in consecutive games (10) and scoring in consecutive away games (7). I could go on and on, citing records and achievements he set in the season but you should just click on the linkhereand be amazed at everything that he achieved.
Despite everything Messi gave for the team last season there were a few occasions when he appeared tired and not playing at his extremely high standards. He appeared to be coasting in a deeper position and not work as hard as he does almost every other game. But that being said, even in those he was still probablyBarcelona'sbest player on the pitch.
Without Messi's heroics Barcelona probably wouldn't have won a single competition (except maybe the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup) which is somewhat discouraging for a team with so many world-class players. But as long asLa Pulgais playing the way he is playing nobody is really complaining - but surely Messi would appreciate some help.
Sam Cooper's View:How do you describe a season like Messi's? Quite simply you describe  it as record breaking. Leo has every record going. Barcelona's top  scorer in official matches, highest number of goals scored in a single  Champions League match, the fourth player to win three Ballon d'Ors and  the second player to win three in a row, a Liga record of 50 goals and  an unmatched 73 goals in all club competitions in one season.
Leo  is a wonder and he is only 25. The Argentine is well on his way to  becoming the greatest player to ever grace the field, only international  success eludes him, and his last season was his greatest. Top Liga  scorer, second highest number of Liga assists and top scorer in the  Champions League. ""Don't write about him, don't try to describe him,""  Guardiola said, ""watch him."" Messi will continue to break records and  continue to makeCristiano Ronaldocurse his luck to be playing in the  same era as the Argentine wonder-kid.
My hopes for next season,  Messi breaks Paulino Alcántara's record of 369 goals in all games. Leo  is 94 goals away and who is brave enough to bet against him?

Moment of the Season:It is absolutely impossible to try to pick one moment from Messi's season. His whole season was an entire moment and it wouldn't be fair to him and the fans to pick just one. I mean nobody in the history of football has ever had a season like this - and it's a long history (well, Pele will probably say he did but that's a completely different story - and continent for that matter). So here you have a video of his 73 goals and 28 assists.

Stats:

Record with Lionel Messiin the starting lineup:42-11-4
2012/13 Outlook:Can we even ask Messi to improve next season? Is it even possible for a human being to post better numbers than he did? Well, if it is Messi is the human being that can make it happen. Once again he will be on the pitch for almost every game and every game he will be giving his all. But whatever number of goals Messi scores and creates he will be absolutely vital for any (potential) success (or failure?) Barça will have.

Messi clashed with sporting director Eric Abidal recently which fuelled speculation he’s not altogether happy at the club and is feeling isolated.

“Messi is the best player in the world. There’s no need to explain anything — I have done so many times in the past.
“Messi will continue at Barca and Messi will retire at Barca. I don’t have the belief that he’s feeling alone. I know many people have said that, but I don’t think it’s the case.”

It’s not just that he didn’t score, yet again, it’s that yet again, he looked lost. He rarely touched the ball and didn’t make the kind of runs that made teammates find him. Arguably, Gerard Piqué was a more effective centerforward than him when the big man left his spot in defense to play upfront.
While there’s no doubt that Alcácer has a lot to answer for given this performance, as well as the whole season so far, there is one excuse that he can legitimately point to.
Alcácer has not played much at all with Lionel Messi. In nine games, Alcácer has only played alongside the Argentine star for 81 minutes, sprinkled in a few different games.
Now, it’s true that Alcácer should be good enough not to rely on any one player to help him get to the correct level, but perhaps what he needs is an outing alongside the best in the world to get him back in form.
Messi attracts double, triple, quadruple and quintuple coverage and is a master assist maker. This is exactly what Alcácer could use given his horrid run of form.
Of course, it’s far from a cure-all. Unless Alcácer gets his stuff in order, he’s never going to dig himself out of the hole. His inability to figure out his role in the system this far into the season is worrying, to say the least.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFzhmYtFZKTEahIySfdgH0moJoQ=/0x0:5000x3434/320x213/filters:focal(2048x681:2848x1481)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51933521/610111782.0.jpeg

“We set up a clause which we think is enough to have Messi retire at FCBarcelona,” he said.
“But having said that, we thought a year ago that the clause for Neymar was also good enough to retain the player, and that proved last summer not to be the case.

There really may never be a number high enough to comfort teams and their concerns around the best players leaving their squad. While it still remains incredibly unrealistic that Messi would ever be purchased at that price, its still a fascinating subplot.

Trpisovsky is well aware just how difficult it will be to play against the Barcelona captain and the attacking threat the visitors offer.
The Slavia boss also explained how he watched Messi bag a hat-trick in the Champions League in Prague against Viktoria Plzen back in 2011.
“I saw Messi in Barcelona’s match against Viktoria Plzen on television, because I had no ticket,” he said.
”Messi is a football genius and he is one of the best in the world.
”I have seen that Barcelona have scored more goals than we have played matches.
”We have said that whoever stops Messi will be immortal and will be recorded in history.”

According toESPN, the Catalan giants “hope” to convince Messi to stay but “some members of the board” have said they are willing to sell the 33-year-old.
Messi is clearly fed-up at Barcelona and hasreportedlytold new boss Ronald Koeman he’s currently closer to leaving than staying after theChampions Leagueshambles.
ESPN reckon Messi’s future has “generated an internal debate among the board” and are thinking about a sale because it would enable Koeman to rebuild the squad.
It’s not clear if any team would be able to afford Messi this summer. Don’t forget his release clause is set at €700 million and he also commands huge wages. He’s also available on a free next summer when his contract expires.
The report sums up by saying most of the board are “relaxed” about the situation and feel Messi can possibly be talked round as his anger over the Bayern defeat fades.
Yet there’s also a warning that “at least one high-ranking source” feels that if Messi is not happy then Barca should sell if an acceptable offer arives.

Five more direct-free kick goals than any CLUB in the last five years. More free-kick goals than any other player in Europe since 2012.

Imagine if you’d never seen him play before and you were told about what he’s achieved in football. How, for a player with little height, he manages to stand head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch week in and week out, and for 15+ years. You simply wouldn’t believe it.
The ‘G.O.A.T’ phrase has become a little too overused for my liking, and depending on your preference of sport, it has been liberally applied to the likes of Federer, Ali and Woods et al.
Messi has to be part of that conversation. It’s no longer right for people to just dismiss his excellence.
In the aftermath of last night’s game, for example, there were multiple messages on social media suggesting he looked good because he was ‘only playing againstValladolid.’
He has set the bar time and time again, and even now people still line up to criticise him.How can they after his display against La Pucela?!
One of his best in a Barca shirt? Undoubtedly.
THE. BEST.pic.twitter.com/QA1SSRG8SR
The goals were magnificent, the assists expertly crafted, however, his entire performance lifted those around him. It was truly a captain’s effort.
To witness his continuing evolution from a goalscorer supreme into a goal creator of renown also shows us yet another example of his ability to adapt his game to fit the team and style required.
What’s more, he does it with effortless ease.
We know too, because we can see it with our own eyes, that these next couple of years are sure to be as successful for him as any other.
He might not score as many - although he’s started off rather well again in 2019/20 - but his football brain will ensure he’s a second or two ahead of his opponents when it comes to chance creation.
There has never been any ceiling to what he could achieve in the game, and that’s as true today as it was when he first stepped out on the pitch for the Catalans.
He stands alone. Period.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBwgA1coosRilbzZCoKyfUDohxY=/0x0:4000x2667/320x213/filters:focal(1680x1014:2320x1654)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65581765/1184278147.jpg.0.jpg

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2010/11/11/1806752/lionel-messi-barcelona-legend-and-the-most-brilliant-player-of-this,Lionel Messi: Barcelona Legend and The Most Brilliant Player of This Generation,45.155.68.129,"Nov 11, 2010","
Unless you've living been on Mars or under a rock for the past five years, you've certainly heard of Lionel Messi: the most talented player of the current generation of footballers and a player whom many tip to become Maradona's heir as the best player of all-time.
Messi might be only 23, but these expectations are more than legitimate: Messi brought them upon himself. The Argentine genuis has been marvelling football fans worldwide ever since he became a full-time pro. In fact, Messi has been in the Fifa Player of the Year top 20 in each of his full years as a pro player: 20th in 2006, second in 2007 and 2008 and winner in 2009. This year, he is a top contender for the award once again, even though Xavi and Iniesta are more likely to take in theory. To sum up, Messi has ALWAYS been at the top.
To make matters even more impressive, 2007 and 2008 years were trophiless years for Barcelona and low-scoring, injury-plagued years for Messi. Still, he managed to be second in the FIFA award on both occasions, nearly beating Cristiano Ronaldo (who had had the best seasn of his life) in the 2008 race. Just imagine if Messi hadn't picked up so many injuries or if Barcelona had picked up silverware... Messi would probably have two more Golden Balls in his pocket by now(he'll certainly get many more in his career, though).
If Messi was already arguably the best in the world, Guardiola's appointment as Barcelona's manager took his game to a whole new level. Guardiola & Leo was truly a match made in heaven. Under Pep, Messi has scored a disbelieving 102 goals, along with 38 assists, in 119 matches. He has basically created 140 goals in 119 matches!

In 2008/2009, he was part of one of the best attacking trios ever with Thiery Henry and Samuel Eto'o. He led the team in scoring with 38 goals and assisted 18 as he led Barcelona to a glorious season and an unprecedented sextuple!
In 2009/2010, with Eto'o gone, Henry dipping in form and Ibrahimovic proving to be a flop, Barcelona became even more reliant on Messi for goals and Leo stepped up, scoring 47 goals in all competitions, thus equaling Ronaldo's record set on 1996/1997 (which is impressive, considering that, unlike the Brazilian, Messi isn't an out-an-out striker).
This season, despite an early injury, he already has 17 goals and six assists in only 15 matches, and the best might be yet to come. His own 47-goal record might actually be beaten by Messi this season.
We can't forget that Messi is only 23 and can only improve. He's a better, more complete today than he was a year ago. His passing, his playmaking skills, his free-kicks, his goalscoring instincts... he has been improving on every aspect of his game, making fans believe that by the time he reaches his peak he might become the best and most complete player in history.
It's still too soon to make such a statement, but there's no doubt that Messi is on the right path. During these five years as a pro, he has always mantained a very high level, but some of his performances have just been otherwordly. In 2006, still a teenager, Messi scored a hat trick in El Classico at Camp Nou to salvage a 3-3 draw. That performance confirmed what everyone at Barcelona knew since Messi was just a youth player: Leo really is a very special player.
In the past two seasons, under Pep Guardiola, setting the world on fire has become a routine for Messi. Among many otherwordly performances, his four goals against Arsenal at Camp Nou in last season's quarter-finals of the Champions League is perhaps the most famous. After that match, pundits all around the world started discussing Messi's place among the all-time greats and comparisons with Maradona became even more regular. On the receiving end of the Messi show, Arsène Wenger was forced to hail Lionel Messi as the best player of this generation.
Right now, there's no doubt that Messi is the best in the world by a very large distance. From Arsène Wenger to Arjen Robben, everyone in the football world acknowleges Messi's unmatched talents. The challenge for Messi is to keep motivated despite the absence of rivals (given Messi's love for football and for the club, it's safe to assume that he will) and work his way to eternal greatness.
Having achieved almost everything with Barcelona, his challenge now will be to lead Argentina to glory, while doing the same with Barcelona. At 23 years old, the sky is the limit for Lionel Messi! Let's hope he reaches it...

The Croatia midfielder, who swapped Barcelona for Sevilla last summer, knows Messi well from his six years at the Camp Nou.
LaLiga Santander player Rakitic, speaking at an event for LiveScore, said he hopes Messi does decide to extend his stay with the Catalan giants.
“I hope that he has a lot of years left and that he decides what is best for him and forFC Barcelona. I had six amazing years playing with him at FC Barcelona and it’s really amazing to have played with him and been on the same team, so hopefully he can stay many more years at FC Barcelona.”
Rakitic also offered his thoughts on the 2020-21 La Liga season so far. Barcelona have suffered a poor start to the campaign and have been beaten four times already in their opening 11 games.
The 32-year-old explained why he thinks his former team have found it tough going so far under new coach Ronald Koeman.
“I think it’s not just about FC Barcelona, it’s maybe also about the situation in general. All the other teams in La Liga Santander have taken steps forward, so the level of competition is now much higher, and these games all are really difficult to play in. All these things make it more difficult.
“Also, for a big team to change their coach and some players can mean sometimes it’s not easy to adjust but for me it’s still clear that FC Barcelona have an amazing team. They still have the best player in the world in Lionel Messi. One of the best things about football is that all teams are competitive and want to beat one another so you have to be ready and if you’re not you can begin losing. I think FC Barcelona will get up to their high standards again and you can expect them to be at 100% soon again for sure.”
Barcelona take on Real Sociedad on Wednesday night in a match which will provide a real test for Koeman’s men. Rakitic and Sevilla, who are in fifth place in the table currently, are back in action on Saturday against Real Valladolid.

Messi is missing from the squad after reportedly deciding to take a break from national team duty.
Yet Argentina are not using his No.10 shirt for games against Guatemala and Colombia, and Scaloni has explained the reasoning behind their decision.
“There is only one answer for your question: every player who was in theWorld Cupkept his number, the ones who came here,” he said.
”In this time, the 10 shirt belongs to Messi and it will stay this way until he decides if he will continue with us or not.
”We aren’t closed to that chance so I chose to keep this number for him. In the future we will see, but if you look at the players who played the World Cup you will see they kept their numbers, and we wait for the future to see what happens, but so far no one is using the 10 because it is exclusive for him and that is my decision. There is nothing else about this.”

Why? Because he made a statement that became controversial, and the club didn't want any of that as they handleLionel Messi'srenewal.
The comments, taken out of context and translated, got a lot of attention in the media and on social media. But were they that bad?
Asked whether Barcelona’s win over Atheltic Club Bilbao was down to only Lionel Messi, this was his answer: ""It was not only Leo. Leo is one of the most important people in the team, but if the team won the tie it was also because of the whole team. Leo without Neymar, without Luis Suárez, without Andres Iniesta, without Gerard Piqué, without the rest, wouldn't be as good, but it's clear that Messi is the best player.""
Gratacós's phrasing was not very good, and he invited controversy because of it. But seen in context, they seem like level-headed, fair, if not simply obvious things to say.
Now there's a story in Mundo Deportivo that Messi's entourage found the sacking confusing. Apparently Messi himself understood Gratacós, who gave him his debut at Barcelona B and maintains a good relationship with the player.
You could argue that Gratacós should have been more careful at this delicate time. But it's also true that his words were twisted and people began grabbing their pitchforks before all the facts were in.

“Playing with Leo is easy because you give him the ball and you know things will happen,” he said.
“Hopefully I can be around Leo for several years, it would be great to learn alongside him.”

He then talked a bit about the team overall and playing for Ronald Koeman.
“Barça already have idols like Messi, Piqué and many more. The young people who are starting out, like Ansu Fati, Riqui and I need to play at a high level to stay in the first team.”
“The position I like to play most is in midfield. Being behind the striker and being able to give the last pass is something that I like so much. But I’m here for whatever the coach needs and to play in whatever position.”

The report claims that Messi can choose to terminate his contract at the end of every season on 30 June and walk away from the Camp Nou.
The clause was inserted into his latest contract that he signed in 2017 and that runs until 2021. Messi said at the time he signed the deal he wanted to finish his career at Barcelona.
There’s no suggestion in the report that Messi is contemplating leaving Barcelona any time soon, but it is certainly an interesting insight if it proves to be true.
Of course Messi has also said that he’d like to play back in Argentina at Newell’s Old Boys before he finally decides to hang up his boots.
And Cadena SER’s Carrusel have a bit more info on this report. They reckon that Messi can only use this clause to leave for a club outside of Europe.
Meanwhile, Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has already spoken about renewing Messi’s contract yet again.
He said back in April that he was planning to sit down with Messi and talk extensions over the coming months.

The news comes just a few days after lifting the FIFA World Cup and winning his second Golden Ball for best player at the tournament. It is said that the agreement was reached during the World Cup, albeit through Messi’s father and agent, Jorge.
When he returns from his celebratory vacation in Argentina, Messi will sit down with the owner and sporting director of PSG to finalize details.
His family is fully settled in Paris and he has been showing his best football after a difficult first season. PSG officials are said to be delighted with him and have been pushing for the extension for months.
Joan Laporta of FC Barcelona has reportedly tried his best to pry Messi back after letting him go. Messi, obviously, has an emotional link with the Catalan club but at the moment they do not have the financial resources to match PSG. Beyond that, he seems happy in Paris and is looking to challenge for the UEFAChampions Leagueagain. Finally, the player may not have the best relationship with Laporta. His departure from Barcelona came as a surprise, when he was told repeatedly by the club president that he would stay only for him to tell Messi at the last minute that it was not possible.
For all those reasons, it is said Messi never negotiated with Barcelona.
Meanwhile, the report says that he never planned on agreeing a move to the MLS. Instead, he merely listened to proposals from Inter Miami’s owner, David Beckham, out of politeness.
The news has been confirmed by Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.

Messi, obviously, has an emotional link with the Catalan club but at the moment they do not have the financial resources to match PSG. Beyond that, he seems happy in Paris and is looking to challenge for the UEFAChampions Leagueagain. Finally, the player may not have the best relationship with Laporta. His departure from Barcelona came as a surprise, when he was told repeatedly by the club president that he would stay only for him to tell Messi at the last minute that it was not possible.
For all those reasons, it is said Messi never negotiated with Barcelona.
Meanwhile, the report says that he never planned on agreeing a move to the MLS. Instead, he merely listened to proposals from Inter Miami’s owner, David Beckham, out of politeness.
The news has been confirmed by Italian transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.

Ousmane Dembele also scored a brilliant goal for Barcelona, but it was Messi who Valverde spoke at length about after the game.
“It’s a blessing to have Messi in your side and a problem for anyone that doesn’t [have him],” he said.
”He makes the extraordinary look routine. Today he scored three goals, with the free kick coming at the moment we needed it in terms of opening the game up. It was a magisterial free-kick, and he never tires of scoring hat-tricks.
”We’re seeing something unique, something that hasn’t been seen for many years. As a player in La Liga, I don’t remember anyone like him. And it will be tough to find anyone else like him in the future.

Messi’s first option is apparently staying at PSG past the end of the season when his current contract expires at the Parc des Princes.

A possible return to Barcelona is also mentioned but it’s not clear yet if the Catalans have the finances or indeed whether Messi wants to return for a second stint.
Moving to MLS does appear to be on Messi’s agenda but such a transfer is said to be unlikely to happen until “2024 or even 2025.”

“The organisation of the club’s wage bill: they had to tackle some salary reductions which were difficult to undertand. Two, we didn’t have money to pay him and we were doing handstands to pay him in installments, which is what they are doing in Paris.

That the captain should be subjected to any sort of heat for his comments is an odd one. Players are often criticised for their ‘PR speak’ to media outlets, so when one comes out and talks honestly and openly, particularly as it’s Leo, he should be applauded rather than castigated.
In any event, his performance against Eibar was vintage.

That the Basques have always been the most of accommodating of opponents for the Argentinian is incidental.
On a day whenBarcelonaneeded a performance of the highest quality, that’s what they produced. The opening 45 was a joy to watch at times, and were it not for Dmitrovic, the score might easily have been four or five in favour of the hosts.
He’d not hit the goal trail for a few games, but once Messi slid home the opener, there was a feeling that this could be his day.
The gap between the two centre-backs became ever wider, and you can’t give Barca that much space within which to work.
Messi’s movement was sharp and instinctive, his finishing back to the level we’ve come to expect from him.

If anything, Messi’s role now is that of a much more supplementary attacker, and yet he’s still the most dangerous weapon that Barca have when he’s on form.
With 20 minutes to go,Antoine Griezmannmaking way for Martin Braithwaite saw the Camp Nou rise in unison to acclaim the Dane.
Some would have you believe that he’s one of the most underwhelming signings for the club in recent times, but he does at least hand the club something different at the business end of the campaign.
He showed as much with a superb assist for Messi’s fourth and a hand in the fifth goal. Whether Setien uses him for anything other than cursory minutes remains to be seen.

FC Barcelona wholeheartedly expresses its gratitude to the player for his contribution to the aggrandisement of the club and wishes him all the very best for the future in his personal and professional life.
The announcement stresses in an official capacity that both the club and the player want to maintain their relationship. This is basically unheard of in any announcement like this. It’s also remarkably short. No big tribute for the player. No count up of stats. Just a token bit of gratitude. If you didn’t know this was Messi, you’d think they were speaking of a squad player. Very strange.
What else is strange? No teammate or club legend or anyone has made any statement. The player is silent, too, as is the club president, Joan Laporta.
And here’s the strangest bit: the player registration deadline is not today. It’s not tomorrow, either. From what we’ve been told, Barcelona has until the end of the month to sort things out. There is no need to make an announcement.
If you were in charge of Barcelona, you’d try to renew Messi’s contract until the very last, even if you were 99% sure you would fail. So you’d keep going until either the deadline came or he told you he had found a new team. All the reports say that he has not found a new team, and again, the statement says that he wants to continue at the Camp Nou.
Taken at face value, the announcement is essentially saying that Laporta is giving up even with time left. Why would Barcelona do this?
Could it be a power play? Imagine La Liga offices right now. The phones must be ringing like crazy. Big money interests asking why, despite both the player and the club wanting him to stay, is the biggest star in world football leaving the league?
Barcelona could be in desperation mode, and trying to play one last trick with this. There is a lot of stake, and a lot of powerful interests. There is the topic of the Super League, there is the investment in La Liga from CVC.
Even if Laporta is attempting a mind game of sorts here, it doesn’t mean it’ll work. There could be something we don’t know about yet at work here, too.
Again,somethingis up. Perhaps it’s not a mindgame. Perhaps we’re in denial. But perhaps there is something more than meets the eye.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7KFMkS4QQvO0jyIjdZ7N9hhTRA0=/0x0:4500x3214/320x213/filters:focal(2268x901:2988x1621)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69684782/1232945174.0.jpg

WhenGerard Piquelifted the ball towards Messi, who sprang free towards goal, it seemed like the record was destined to be broken. Instead, Messi was apparently hurt in a collision with Benfica's goalkeeper Artur.
Messi kept running, and rather than go down looking for a penalty, attempted a chipped shot which Artur was able to save. However, he immediately fell to the ground and had to be carried off the field.
As teammate Sergi Roberto said, ""when Messi gets hit, he always stands up immediately as if nothing happened."" Because of this, Roberto, along with the silent Camp Nou and worried fans across the globe, began to fear the worst.
Some speculated it could be an ACL tear, which would sideline the Argentine magician for several months. However, the good news is that initial reports suggest the injury is actually relatively small.
FCBarcelona'sDirector of Football Andoni Zubizarreta declared that the injury seemed ""minor."" Goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto told reporters that Messi seemed calm and felt fine while the doctors examined him.
Since, the club has said that Messi has suffered a big knock on the outside of his left knee, but an MRI test is being done as a precaution. Barca's coachTito Vilanovasaid ""the feeling is: it's not bad, but it's early.""
If it's just the external bruise, Messi shouldn't be out long. A week, maybe.

The rumoris that the plan could be approved Tuesday of next week. If that is the case, then Barcelona would move with immediate effect to try to sign Messi. That may hinge on the club confirming certain sales. However, it is understood that signing Messi is one of club president Joan Laporta’s priorities.
The club is said to be optimistic about the situation, but Messi’s entourage has another attitude. They see the offer from Saudi Arabia as more realistic.
According to the gossip pages, the Saudis are preparing for Messi to announce he is joining next Tuesday as well.
They are making an effort that they hope will culminate in the FIFA World Cup winner giving his final OK so they can announce the signing next week.
Their offer, a truly ludicrous 1.2 billion euro contract, would be the highest in the history of sports. But Messi himself has not agreed to it.

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2016/3/2/11144794/is-lionel-messi-the-best-anything-ever,Is Lionel Messi The Best Anything Ever?,45.94.47.66,"Mar  2, 2016","Yesterday – March 1st– theTelegraph’s Jonathan Liew postedan article discussing the validity of comparisons between Steph Curry and Lionel Messi, and the media’s tendency to describe those leading the way in their respective fields as ""the Messi of _____"". It’s an interesting piece, and worth your time. More interesting than Liew’s main point – to me, at least – was his friend Ed’s theory that Messi, by virtue of being the best player in the world’s most popular sport at the time of its all-time qualitative peak, is arguably better at football than any person has ever been at anything else.
It’s a fascinating thought, albeit one that could easily be dismissed as overly simplistic and linear: how can we know for sure that Messi is better at football than Mozart was at composing and performing music? Or better than Napoleon was at leading an army? Or better than Da Vinci was at just about everything he turned his hand to? We can’t, and the truth is it probably doesn’t matter. There’s little to be achieved by attempting to rank genii.
That said, Messi obviously belongs in the company of such genii. There’s a clear ‘before Messi’ and ‘after Messi’ divide in the timeline of the global game, and the lives of millions have been enriched by watching him do his thing on an extremely regular basis for a very long time. For a quiet, shy, family man who merely plays sport for a living, to have attained such historic importance is quite staggering.
And yet it’s simultaneously completely understandable, as anyone who’s gone to the stadium to see Messi at his best can and will attest. As someone who has been lucky enough to see him score 15 goals in only 6 games, nothing has made me doubt my atheism like watching Messi play football, and nothing else ever will. When confronted with such luminescent, overpowering and perfect beauty, it feels frankly ludicrous to deny the existence of the divine.
There’s a brilliant video of Messi’s solo goal in last season’s Copa del Rey final, as seen from pitchside. You’ve probably seen it before, but it’s embedded below anyway. It’s a sensational piece of footage, and should be preserved as some kind of World Heritage artefact – not just because it documents one of the best ever’s best ever goals from metres away, but also because it showshow it feltto be metres from one of the best ever’s best ever goals.

When Messi starts his run, there are a few encouraging shouts but nothing more. When he suddenly bends space and time to skip between a trio of Athletic Club defenders, the entire Camp Nou crowd erupts in astonishment. A bald man a few rows in front of the cameraman rockets out of his seat and into the air, hands on his head in disbelief, and a small town’s worth of people scream ""¡olé!"" in unison. As Messi bears down on goal, the anticipation palpably increases, and when he slams the ball emphatically past the goalkeeper, there’s a deafening explosion of noise.
It’s not ""we’re winning in the Cup final!"" noise, though – it’s even more than that. It’s somehow more visceral, more euphoric than the reaction of a football crowd. It’s less a response to the consequences of the act for the fans – ""we’re going to win!"" – and more a response to the act itself on a human level – ""That. Was. Amazing."" It’s an outpouring of pure and spiritual emotion that shows that what happened was more than just a goal: it was a moment of genuine transcendence. A few rows behind the cameraman, a boy is reduced to tears.
He wasn’t the only one. More than 9,000 kilometres from the Camp Nou, in a non-descript bar in the north of Quito, I sat through the replays, agape, and then hurried to the bathroom to dry my eyes, hoping that everyone else had been too busy watching the incredible happenings on-screen to notice my reaction. I dare say there were at least thousands more watching on TV around the world who had the same reaction.
That was just one of the countless moments Messi has given us – the ‘us’ here referring to the human race, not just theculéfanbase – that have confirmed his status as a historically important figure. He’s long since outgrown the moniker of ‘the best player in the world’ and each season sees him produce yet more goals, assists, passes and dribbles which further underscore his status as ‘the best player ever’, and these days even that title doesn’t do him justice.
Whether or not Messi is the bestanythingever is ultimately immaterial, but Liew’s friend Ed certainly has a case. There can’t have been many people in the history of the world with the power to convert 95,000 paying spectators from football fans to an awestruck and emotional mess in just twenty seconds, and have the same impact on hundreds of millions watching across the globe. Fewer still have done so time and time again over a period of more than ten years.
What would the world’s classical music lovers give to be able to see Mozart perform live? How much would the world’s historians pay to have been there on the battlefields of Europe to see Napoleon in action? Can anyone imagine what it must have been like to watch Da Vinci at work?
This is the privilege we have withLionel Messi. We’re unfathomably fortunate on a cosmic scale, and even luckier still that the technology exists to preserve every moment of wonder – every moment when, for just a split second, even the non-believers could see the face of god – forever.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LuMyiap7_7wdy_XlbVWYgBWUm3E=/0x0:5123x3415/320x213/filters:focal(0x0:5123x3415)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/48976703/GettyImages-511889034.0.jpg

The “issues also with other players” part is about Sergio Agüero, Eric García, Memphis Depay and Emerson Royal, who have already been announced as Barça players but cannot be registered for the same reasons as Messi.
Messi at PSG seems like the logical next step given how much we’ve heard of the rumor and the fact that Neymar and Argentina national teammates Leandro Paredes and Ángel Di María are there, but it’s still really hard to process that the GOAT is leaving in these circumstances.
Joan Laporta is giving a press conference on Friday to shed some light into all this insanity, but it seems as though Messi will have a new home before too long.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnNXseKfLQXq86Y34HaFi28jRSw=/0x0:2590x1727/320x213/filters:focal(1302x381:1716x795)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69685851/1232937014.0.jpg 
https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2014/7/2/5864333/barcelona-president-bartomeu-messi-suarez-transfer-rumours,"Bartomeu, on Messi: 'Not Transferable'",185.199.231.45,"Jul  2, 2014","The old man has spoken. Finally.
FCBarcelonapresident, Josep Maria Bartomeu, gave the media a lot of time during an interview on Wednesday afternoon. Bartomeu opened it with a quick statement about his plans for the immediate future, including ticket sales, social efforts and business decisions. Then, the president answered questions. A LOT of questions. He responded to all of them, and was honest and clear about his answers. Well, not including transfers, but you know how it goes ...
On his opening statement, Bartomeu talked about the expansion plans. He wants to add qualified people to the board of directors, to help improve decision-making and marketing and bussiness strategies. He talked about some social projects and promised a record on ticket sales for next season.
Then, it was time togive the people what they want. Here are some highlights of his answers:
Lionel Messi
""He's not transferable. He is not going to be sold under any circumstances. We love Leo and he is the guy we're working with, because he is the key to the rebuilding project we are into. That's why we adapted his contract, he is very happy. I know that he doesn't want to leave and he knows that he is our leader. I wish good luck to him and Argentina in theWorld Cup.""
Luis Suárez and meeting withLiverpoolofficials
""We are working on a deep rebuilding of our team, so I can't tell you exactly what signings are we negotiating. There are things going on but I can't tell you.""
""We've been on a lot of trips for months but I can't explain it. We are trying to be as cautious as possible"".
""Suárez is a Liverpool FC player. He is not one of our players, so I can't comment on him too much. What I will say is: I think it's very important that he apologized. It's honorable for a person to admit he's wrong when he makes mistakes. I understand that things can happen in the heat of competition, but it's important to his career, whether it's at Liverpool or anywhere else, it's important for him to admit that he was wrong and apologize. I'm happy for him"".
Transfers
""Like I said, we can't comment on our transfers until they're official. You know we've signed Ter Stegen, Bravo and Rakitic, but there are nothing else official yet. I can tell you that there are a lot of negotiations advancing well, and we expect them to happen. As for the center-backs, Zubi told me he has the names and the talks are advancing but we won't reveal anything.""
""We have the money to complete all signings we are planning. It can be exactly what I told you (around 150 million euros). It can be more, it can be less. But I assure you we have the money to complete every operation.""
""We have all the names, yes. We're negotiating and we're happy with how it's going. I can't reveal the names, but we have them. The negotiations get a little tricky during the World Cup because teams want to wait to see if their players value is going up, but that won't stop us. We are negotiating and the signings are happening soon"".
Xavi
""Everybody has some opinion on the 'Xavi Subject'. We will respect his decision, doesn't matter what it is. We trust him, we love him and we believe he is the greatest player and representative of this great institution. He has earned the right to do whatever he wants and we will respect his decision. And I can guarantee you he's coming back in the future, because we believe he is going to be an amazing manager for us.""
Cesc Fàbregas
""We are sad he is leaving. We loved him, and we tried everything we could to sign him when Pep Guardiola asked for him. We always treated him well and he's done the same with us. It's probably a good career move to him to joinChelsea. I wish him the best.""
There you have it, folks. What do you think of Bartomeu's interview? Do you like his answers?

The midfielder spoke toVoetbal Internationalabout Sergio Busquets’s departure from the club and made it clear he’s going to miss playing alongside the captain.
‘It will be different next season when Busquets is gone,” he said. “He played for Barcelona for 15 years, you will notice that when such a great player leaves.
“I really enjoyed playing with him, especially when we were next to each other. We complemented each other really well and I learned a lot from him even though we are different types of players.”
De Jong also went on to talk about Lionel Messi and toldDe Telegraafthat he’s disappointed Barcelona weren’t able to bring the GOAT back to the club.
“I think every team would like to have Lionel there because he always makes the difference,” he added.
“It is a shame he is not coming back to Barcelona. I would have loved to have him back here, his return would have been great. Now we will see who joins and who leaves.”
De Jong is currently preparing for the Nations League Final Four. The Netherlands are in action in the semi-finals on Wednesday against Croatia.

That's the unique position that FCBarcelonasuperstarLionel Messifinds himself in this week, as he unwittingly sparked outrage in Egypt by agreeing to donate a used pair of football boots in an appearance on Egyptian TV.
During his cameo on the well-known show, ""Yes, I am famous"" on MBC, Messi offered this unique donation for quite obvious reasons -- he is a footballer after all, and a match-worn pair of his boots can certainly fetch a high-price at auction. However, unknown to Messi, the shoe doesn't have a great reputation in the Arab world, including in Egypt, where its association with the lowly foot pretty much leaves it in last place in the unofficial clothes rankings.
Never mind that Leo didn't show the soles of his boots, Egyptians quickly took to social media to decry Messi's donation as an insult, with one particularly dramatic member of parliament staring down a camera in disbelief while holding his own shoe when the topic was raised in an interview. He then went on to threaten to attack Messi with the donated shoes as well, which is just lovely.

After all, Leo is addicted to playing football and is really, really, really stubborn when it comes to playing through injuries, even the small ones. He's never substituted, except in preseason games, and even then he's angry to be replaced. The only time Messi is not playing is when the doctors quite frankly prohibit him.
That's not the case here, since Messi will slow down the pace of his training and will treat the problem, but he hasn't been ruled out of the weekend game against Alavés.

However, it’s also possible they have gotten a little carried away in all the excitement:
Jorge Messi half muttered a ‘sí’ when asked if they’re studying the option of staying at Barça for another season by@DeportesCuatrojust now. Another day of talks ahead
Jorge Messi met with Barcelona for talks on Wednesday where it seems little progress was made, with both clubs unwilling to shift their position.
Deportes Cuatro are also reporting that Barca were told Messi has offers from Manchester City, Juventus, and Paris Saint-Germain but his club simply aren’t interested.
Therefore, Messi is now thinking about spending one last season at Barcelona which would also allow him to be able to say goodbye to the club and the fans properly.
Messi reportedly wants to resolve his future “as soon as possible” so he can get back to playing, and the report claims “the next few hours are vital” to the outcome of this saga.

This ispart twoof a series of three posts about my favorite player,Lionel Messi.  Like Messi, I was diagnosed at a young age with growth hormone deficiency, and, like Lionel, I was cured of it--although, unfortunately, I was neither a gifted young footballer nor contacted by FCBarcelona.  These posts will focus on three parts of Lionel's game: dribbling, passing/vision, and intangibles/movement.
Part 1
Passing has always been an underrated part of Lionel Messi's game.  Not that anybody had dared to argue that he wasn't a particularly capable passer of the football (as mostly every La Masia graduate is), but it wasn't until last year, where adeeper, ""freer"" roleaccelerated Messi's assist numbers, that anybody seemed to be really taking notice:

Lionel Messi ""Orgasmic Passing""fromemeryzachonVimeo.
But truth is Messi has always been a kind of hybrid player, both an excellent finisher and distributor.  Coaches for his national team have always tried to figure out how to utilize Lionel's talents.  Why isolate him on the wing when he can influence so much more of the game?  Why ask him to play centre-forward when he can play theengancheposition, even better than the likes of Riquelme, Cambiasso, and Pastore?  But I'm not here to talk about Messi's positioning.  For now, I want to talk abouthowMessi passes,howhe thinks on the ball, and what makes him an evenbetter,more effective passer than even some of the midfield maestros on his own team.
""The Messi Ball""
There are basically two types of passes that Messi loves to play: aspecificpass and anon-specificpass (I'll get to that explanation in a minute).
The first one (shown in the above video) can occur in two ways, either as Messi drops deep and frequently rightward from the centre-forward positionoreven when he is not withdrawn.  The destination of Messi's pass here is to find a wide-playing forward, Villa or Pedro usually, who is playing just behind the full-back.  Now, it's important that the recipient of Messi's pass is behind the defender for a few reasons:1)The defender is unaware of the attacker's run and can't time his response to it.2)The defender is drawn to Messi, which allows Messi to discern when to make the pass.3)The defender is not ""goal side"" of the recipient as to be able to make an easier tackle.  Now, here's how it works:

Using the Arsenal game as an example, we have Villa tucking behind Sagna (the right fullback) and Messi dropped off from his centre-forward position with the ball running at the goal. Arsenal's defense now has a decision to make: do one of their centre-backs come out and confront Messi like Mourinho ordered Carvalho in theSupercopa...or do they stay still and allow Messi to run at them full-steam?  Logically, they chose to not take that risk; however, the knock-on effect is that the defense has to shift to compensate for the CB (in this scenario, it's Koscielny) approaching Messi.  What Messi is looking for when this hapens is a veryspecificlane that suddenly opens up.
Now, remember that in this example suddently the defense is shifting to the left (Messi's right).  And this can only favor one person--you got it: Villa.  Magically, Villa can hang wide and await a diagonal ball between the centre-back and fullback because there is not only space there for the pass with one less defender but the defense is suddenly out of shape.  The funny thing about this pass is that it's also the favorite pass of Xavi and Iniesta, and you used to see a lot more of it from those players when Messi was playing to the right.  And that's the key difference, andadvantage, insofar that Messi is playing the ball muchcloserto the intended target, while additionally he is drawing defenders and opening up spaces...while Xavi and Iniesta, with their deep-lying role and limited (at least in comparison to Messi) dribbling abilities, can't do as effectively.
So, yes, that is aspecificpass that Messi has developed now that his role has become more central and thusly more focal in this phenomenal Barcelona side.  But that's not the only type of pass Messi does...so what about all of those others?

I'm going to lump all of them into what I call ""non-specific Messi passes.""   With the earlier pass/assist, it's something veryspecificto Messi'sroleon the team--how he vacates space in the center of the pitch, how he draws defenders in a particular area--and while there is slight variety in it (as many of you might have anticipated, Messi's assist in the Arsenal game was when Villa was behind acentre-back--but it's roughly still thesamepass) one can basically list the permutations fairly quickly.  On the other hand, Messi does a whole lot of passing in Barcelona's games that isn't so specific; in fact, frequently he drops into midfield to just simply pass or help out because Xavi/Iniesta/Busquets are having a hard time getting the ball forward.  It's here, I think, where we realize just how talented Messi is as a team player, how he is not only capable of dribbling around the midfield in ways that Iniesta can't do but how he can just as well slot in and keep the ball ""flowing"" to the final third.
Imagine the difficulty for a defender: you not only have to getnearMessi, but you have to understand that he can just as much pass around you to beat you as dribble around you.  This is precisely why when a team bottles themselves up like Milan did this week, Messi will seemingly go full-throttle into the belly of the beast.  Yes, he's looking for an opening to get to goal--one, must never forget that he is always looking to score--but he's also asking the defenders to lose their shape to possibly create a quick ball to a Barcelona player with a space now opened up.  The brilliance of Messi is not simply that he can get into those micro-pockets that no other player on the planet can but that he canpassonce he's there.
In conclusion, passing is as much to Messi's game as dribbling. The two, in fact, are rather reliant on each other; they bolster each other because superiority at one allows even more superiority at another.  With Messi finishing last season second in Europe in assists, I don't think anybody can doubt La Pulga's remarkable talents as a world-class distributor.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mO7xNuWd8O16aoVF3mFo3ik0bRk=/0x44:917x655/320x213/filters:focal(0x44:917x655)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/photo_images/4032114/124864867.jpg

“As things stand I think that giving Messi a break would not be a bad thing. Or maybe he should take a decision to have a rest. The players feel the need to give him (Messi) the ball. There is a lack of personality.
”What would happen if you take Messi out of this team? Why don’t we (rest him) and try to form a team without Messi? That might allow some other players, who are very good for their clubs, bloom for the national team.”

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2012/2/6/2774622/lionel-messi-jose-mourinho-cristiano-ronaldo,"The Weekly Review: Week Five: Lionel Messi, Jose Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo",38.154.227.167,"Feb  6, 2012","When will we learn to not get ahead of ourselves? All this week, across multiple sports, individuals and teams have been getting ahead of themselves. Take a look at the Superbowl: many expected that Tom Brady and the Patriots would atone for their 18-1 season by defeating the Giants, but it was not to be. Despite leading late on, they conceded a touchdown with 0:57 left, and ended up losing. Again.
Then we have the UFC, where the press department had already started to hype up a bout between Nick Diaz and Georges St. Pierre. Unfortunately for them, Carlos Condit fought a perfect fight to win a unanimous decision and set up a fight with GSP upon his return. Then we move back to familiar ground: football, and the English Premier League in particular.
Maybe you saw the match yesterday, but Chelsea raced into a surprising 3-0 lead over Manchester United, only to concede two penalties and a late header from Chicharito to draw 3-3. What about the reports suggesting thatJose Mourinhois ready to leave the Bernabeu as the first man to win league titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain? Isn’t that a little premature? Here are my thoughts on the week just passed.
Lionel Messi
The Argentine is fast becoming a sensitive subject among someBarcelonafans, with a few criticising the three-time Ballon D’Or winner for his recent performances in front of goal. Why you might ask? Well, I have an incline it is about jumping to conclusions...how many people EXPECT Lionel Messi to score in a game? Then how many EXPECT Messi to grab the man of the match award through some virtuoso performance?
The truth of the matter is that Lionel Messi performs under immense pressure each and every game, and when his teammates are struggling, that pressure multiplies. While some believe that when Messi play badly, Barcelona plays badly, I tend to think it is the other way round: When Barcelona play badly, Lionel Messi follows suit.
Unlike Portuguese forward,Cristiano Ronaldo, Leo needs his teammates in almost everything he does. Whether it is playing a one-two, a through ball or even when he embarks on a solo run, he needs his teammates to move for him, anticipate the pass and draw defenders away with decoy runs. The problem is that no-one is moving; few are anticipating a pass, and when Leo does venture forward on a solo run because no one else is moving for a pass, he has to battle with at least three defenders.
What happens is that he finds it more difficult to do what he does best. I saw on our match review comments that someone thinks Messi did not deserve to be man of the match, and while I voted forJavier Mascherano, I can see why people voted for Messi. It’s hard to ignore someone who scored one and set up the winner, regardless of whether or not they ""lived up to expectation"". At the end of the day, Messi continued with his goal-a-game record, and ensured that he still has an assist every other game. Contributing to 56 goals this season, I would think twice before criticising the little man.
Jose Mourinho
So, The Special One is ""leaving"" this summer eh? I doubt there is a single Culé around the world that will shed a tear if the reports are indeed true. Jose Mourinho has brought out the best and the worst in both Real Madrid and FC Barcelona by making El Clasico like warfare. For that, we should simultaneously thank and condemn him. After all, without him, there would not have been a 5-0 drubbing, or a legendary Lionel Messi run in the Champions League semi-final, mainly because Real would have lost at the round of 16. While we hate the antics, it is hard to think of a Clasico without Mourinho. What’s the fun in 90 minutes of football?
Well, thankfully/unfortunately (delete depending on personal preference) these rumours are probably just that: rumours. Why would Jose Mourinho leave for Arsenal, especially if the Gunners continue to struggle in search of Champions League football? Is there a job for him to return to at Chelsea, and if there is, then why would he take it? The defense is suspect, and the team is a far cry from the one he built a few years back. In my opinion, it would take hundreds of millions to transform the current Chelsea side into one that Mourinho could use in his system and with Financial Fair Play on the horizon that is unlikely to happen.
He has talked about replacingSir Alex Fergusonat Manchester United, but SAF is not going to retire for at least a couple more years. Manchester City seem content withRoberto Mancini, leaving England a difficult destination for Jose. I think he would only ever consider going back to Inter Milan, or (less likely) enhancing his C.V. further with a spell at Bayern Munich. Unless Mourinho wants to try his hand at international management, there are few jobs out there for him, and even less that are better than Real Madrid.
Cristiano Ronaldo
Sorry about the weekly review being more orientated towards Real Madrid, but apparently, Ronaldo is contemplating a return to England, just like Jose Mourinho. Now, this story does come courtesy of the Daily Mail, so is about as refutable as the crazy old bloke down the street, in fact, they didn’t even spell check the article. According to them, Ronaldo is""growling disillusioned with life at Real Madrid"". Either Ronaldo is so pissed off with fans booing him, he is growling with anger, or this story is merely a way to boost reads...
The article suggests that he is sick and tired of people questioning his attitude, so he thinks that returning to England would sort that out. Well, considering Manchester City are the only club with enough money to spend on the Portuguese winger, I doubt his problems would go away. United fans would boo him, Chelsea fans would boo him, and I don’t even know whether or not the City fans would take kindly to him. Regardless, Cristiano is staying put, bar some dramatic turn of events.

In an interview, the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder said that “the main thing was for us to decide and understand that Leo is not always the first or best option when you’re looking to pass the ball. We have to give him the ball when he can take advantage. That was something that we used to not do and we have improved since.”
Parades is part of a young crop of players learning to play alongside Messi after Lionel Scaloni took over as coach after the last FIFAWorld Cup.
“How can it not be easy to play with him? He’s incredible. In my head, when he has the ball and you see two, three, or four get near him, you say, ‘well, it’s time to get ready, because he might lose the ball.’ You start running backwards, and all of a sudden, he squeezes out in between those four and continues with the ball.

Bartomeu also opened up on the recent controversy over Messi’s future.
“As president I will not enter into any conflict with Messi,”he said.
“Messi is our captain, the leader. We have seen him in recent days and does his talking on the field as we have seen. The issue is parked. What has been said has been said.
“I couldn’t allow, like anyone on the board or coaching staff, to let the best player in the world go. The team needs him. Things have to be discussed at home. You have to support the team and the players.

WhenGerard Piquelifted the ball towards Messi, who sprang free towards goal, it seemed like the record was destined to be broken. Instead, Messi was apparently hurt in a collision with Benfica's goalkeeper Artur.
Messi kept running, and rather than go down looking for a penalty, attempted a chipped shot which Artur was able to save. However, he immediately fell to the ground and had to be carried off the field.
As teammate Sergi Roberto said, ""when Messi gets hit, he always stands up immediately as if nothing happened."" Because of this, Roberto, along with the silent Camp Nou and worried fans across the globe, began to fear the worst.
Some speculated it could be an ACL tear, which would sideline the Argentine magician for several months. However, the good news is that initial reports suggest the injury is actually relatively small.
FCBarcelona'sDirector of Football Andoni Zubizarreta declared that the injury seemed ""minor."" Goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto told reporters that Messi seemed calm and felt fine while the doctors examined him.
Since, the club has said that Messi has suffered a big knock on the outside of his left knee, but an MRI test is being done as a precaution. Barca's coachTito Vilanovasaid ""the feeling is: it's not bad, but it's early.""

The Catalan club is hoping that La Liga will officially approve their “viability plan” that maps out their signings and sales for the upcomingtransfer window. That would ensure that new contracts added to the squad will be registered according to Financial Fair Play rules.
The rumoris that the plan could be approved Tuesday of next week. If that is the case, then Barcelona would move with immediate effect to try to sign Messi. That may hinge on the club confirming certain sales. However, it is understood that signing Messi is one of club president Joan Laporta’s priorities.
The club is said to be optimistic about the situation, but Messi’s entourage has another attitude. They see the offer from Saudi Arabia as more realistic.
According to the gossip pages, the Saudis are preparing for Messi to announce he is joining next Tuesday as well.
They are making an effort that they hope will culminate in the FIFA World Cup winner giving his final OK so they can announce the signing next week.
Their offer, a truly ludicrous 1.2 billion euro contract, would be the highest in the history of sports. But Messi himself has not agreed to it.

That's the unique position that FCBarcelonasuperstarLionel Messifinds himself in this week, as he unwittingly sparked outrage in Egypt by agreeing to donate a used pair of football boots in an appearance on Egyptian TV.
During his cameo on the well-known show, ""Yes, I am famous"" on MBC, Messi offered this unique donation for quite obvious reasons -- he is a footballer after all, and a match-worn pair of his boots can certainly fetch a high-price at auction. However, unknown to Messi, the shoe doesn't have a great reputation in the Arab world, including in Egypt, where its association with the lowly foot pretty much leaves it in last place in the unofficial clothes rankings.
Never mind that Leo didn't show the soles of his boots, Egyptians quickly took to social media to decry Messi's donation as an insult, with one particularly dramatic member of parliament staring down a camera in disbelief while holding his own shoe when the topic was raised in an interview. He then went on to threaten to attack Messi with the donated shoes as well, which is just lovely.

Previously, Gerard Romero, a well-informed Barcelona-based journalist, had said that Barcelona were in pole position to get his signature, contrary to most reporting at the time.
Gastón Edul, one of the most connected Argentine journalists, initially made it clear he believed Messi would stay at PSG. But he since has admitted that he was no longer as certain as before that Messi would renew his deal.
Romero continued to say on his Twitch stream that at the moment, Messi was not keen on staying in Paris. That would open up other options - a return to Barcelona, a chance to play in the MLS with Inter Miami, or a turn to play in his own country, Argentina, with Newell’s Old Boys.
Romero has stressed that while the door for a return is open, nothing is certain at all, and it’s still entirely possible that he will extend his contract with the Parisians.
There is also the question of whether Barcelona will be able to afford Messi’s salary, considering their troubles with La Liga’s strict Financial Fair Play controls. Romero stressed that something could be worked out given how much more income the player would bring to the league.
Finally, there is the tense relationship between his agent and father, Jorge Messi, and Barcelona’s president, Joan Laporta. In fact, it is the father who seems most opposed to a return to Barcelona.

That we are in the midst of a golden era at the Camp Nou is undeniable. In the seven seasons prior to the one just started, FCBarcelonahas captured three Champions League crowns, five La Liga titles, five Supercopas de España, a pair of UEFA Supercups, a Club World Cup and a Copa del Rey.
Beyond the otherworldly run of team success, however, something special has been unfolding at the Camp Nou. Something once-in-a-lifetime special. While the current dynasty was sparked in the middle of the last decade by the brilliance of Ronaldinho, it was not until after the toothy Brazilian’s departure that it reached its pinnacle. Seldom does a club bid adieu to a two-time World Footballer of the Year and proven champion with both club and country- admittedly one that had become increasingly injury-prone and was clearly exhibiting signs ofdramaticdecline.
Then again, seldom is a club afforded the luxury of celebrating the exit of one of the greatest players of a generation by simply handing the reigns to one of the greatest individual talents the game has ever seen. It’s impossible to credit any one man for a period of such sustained greatness, particularly given Barcelona’s incredible stockpile of attacking talent, butLionel Messiis building as strong a case for such an honor as you’re ever going to see in club football.
One of the game’s all-time great prodigies, Messi has not only cemented his name atop the list of today’s superstars, he is poised to enter football lore as this generation’s transcendent star. To watch him make the incredible seem mundane is to know that you are watching greatness. Messi’s game does not feature the step-overs and theatrics that we’ve come to expect from the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo. Rather, his greatness is defined by a ridiculous combination of speed, agility, maneuverability and ball control, with little in the way of wasted effort.
Going back to the middle of the last century, every decade has featured a phenomenal talent whose star outshone those of his contemporaries. In the 1940s and 50s it was another Argentine, Alfredo Di Stéfano; the 1960s belonged to Pelé; Johan Cruyff dominated the 1970s for Ajax and Barcelona; the 1980s brought the brilliance of Messi’s countryman, Diego Maradona; the 1990s and early-21stCentury brought the duel of greatness between Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldinho. Messi is not only a lock to enter the pantheon as the face of his era, but barring catastrophic injury, is poised to trump the accomplishments (for club, not yet for country- elephant acknowledged) of the legends that preceded him.
As of June 2008, he’d won two La Liga medals, a Champions’ League medal and the 2005 FIFA Under-20 World Cup, in which he was the top scorer and Most Outstanding Player. He’d become the youngest player to appear (and score) in a World Cup for Argentina, and had netted 42 goals in 110 games with Barcelona, becoming the youngest goal scorer in the club’s history as well.
On top of all that, he was named 2005’s Argentine Player of the Year (at age 18), 2006’s Young Player of the Year by both World Soccer magazine and FIFPro and Europe’s U-21 Footballer of the Year in 2007. That year, he also won La Liga’s Foreign Player of the Year and the EFE Trophy, awarded to the top Ibero-American (Spain, Portugal, Mexico, Central and South America) player in Spain.
This was all, y’know, prior to his 21stbirthday.
In the years since, he’s continued building a resume that compares favorably to any player of comparable age in history not named Pelé. He’s made a mockery of the difficulty associated with finding the back of the net against top-flight competition. Messi has suited up in 276 official appearances across all competitions for FC Barcelona senior squad at just 24 years of age, scoring 189 goals, netting multiple goals a staggering 61 times (22.1% of the time), with at least three in a game on ten occasions. He’s certainly not lacked for efficiency in racking up his gaudy numbers, scoring on ~22% of roughly 860 shots and tickling the twine with an awesome 44% of his shots on goal. And lest you think ""La Pugla"" is nothing more than a monomaniacal gunner, he’s assisted on another 80 Barcelona goals over the past 6+ seasons, including a career-best 24 last season and seven in seven games this season.
The aforementioned goal tally places Messi third in history for goals scored in all competitions as a member of FC Barcelona. The man currently heading the list is César Rodríguez Álvarez, who scored 235 times for the club between 1939 and 1955, the last of his goals coming at age 35. Next up is Laszlo Kubala, a Hungarian transplant who struck 196 times in 11 seasons with Barcelona, also doing so into his mid-30s. If Messi is able to maintain his current, obscene scoring pace (100 goals in 108 games the past two seasons, and nine in seven games in 2011-12), he will occupy the top spot on this list before his 25thbirthday. To put this in perspective, in 741 games over 16 seasonsReal Madridlegend Raúl, one of the great goal scorers in La Liga history, managed 323 goals.
Similarly, in league play, his 124 goals, again, trail only the totals for Rodríguez (195) and Kubala (131). Messi should lay claim to #2 some time in the coming weeks, and is unlikely to have to wait past his 26thbirthday to overtake Rodríguez.
In terms of Champions League scoring, in 58 appearances Messi has tallied 37 goals, 11 shy of Andriy Shevchenko’s record total of 48. If he is able to replicate last season’s 12-goal performance in the competition- which itself tied Ruud van Nistelrooy’s single-season record- he’d lay claim to the top spot there as well.
Finally, looking at overall goal totals, a figure that takes into account friendlies and exhibitions (a sketchy figure, as it’s believed that totals for players whose careers predated widespread media coverage are somewhat inflated), Messi ranks seventh in club history with 206, just over halfway to Paulino Alcântara’s record of 357. Messi is a virtual lock to vault to #1 before age 30, and has a decent shot at doing so by 27 or 28. Incredible.
Now, the true magic of Lionel Messi’s game cannot be quantified. It’s even difficult to put into words. What makes him so special? Maybe it’s the size, or rather, lack of size. Due to a growth hormone deficiency, he stands just 5’7"" tall and weighs less than 150 pounds, making his ability to command the attention of every defender on the field all the more amazing. His counterparts dwarf him and his own uniform often appears several sizes too large, but he is never overmatched. It’s as though the gods thought it unfair to couple that talent with an imposing physique.
He’s drawn comparisons to Maradona, not the least of which came from Maradona himself, who has said, ""Messi is my Maradona."" This is hardly shocking given their shared heritage, as well as each man’s diminutive stature and penchant for singlehandedly mounting a devastating attack:

Is it the way the ball sticks to his feet? The way he slithers through, and flies past, world-class defenders, making them look peg-legged and possibly inebriated? His apparent immunity to mental blunders? Yes… but there’s more.
It’s the way in which he commands the attention of everyone watching. From opposing defenders to television viewers thousands of miles away, to his own teammates, Messi never fails to mesmerize, whether he’s playing for a championship or in a preseason exhibition (I know, I know, not for Argentina’s senior national team. Whatever.).
Lionel Messi not only lives up to the hype, he exceeds it. From his hat trick in March 2007 against Real Madrid (the first of his career and the first in a Clásico since 1994-95), to his awe-inspiring, Maradona-like goal againstGetafein the 2007 Copa del Rey, to his four-goal annihilation of Arsenal in the second leg of last season’s Champions League quarterfinal, to an incredible flick and volley in 2007-08 that leftSevillakeeper Andres Palop frozen in his tracks, to Sunday’s hat trick in the 8-0 drubbing ofOsasuna- on the heels of consecutive disappointing results- Messi seizes a moment in a way that only the truly special ones do.
Now, just over a month into the 2011-12 season, it’s obvious that he’s picked up where he left off last season, when he scored 53 times in 55 games, frequently delivering plays that seem to take the game to its highest elevation. Despite my best efforts, however, one can only comprehend what separates Lionel Messi from his peers by watching him play. Only then is it apparent that the man that is often the smallest player in the game is in fact its biggest star, and perhaps already the greatest individual force in the history of Spanish football.

This ispart twoof a series of three posts about my favorite player,Lionel Messi.  Like Messi, I was diagnosed at a young age with growth hormone deficiency, and, like Lionel, I was cured of it--although, unfortunately, I was neither a gifted young footballer nor contacted by FCBarcelona.  These posts will focus on three parts of Lionel's game: dribbling, passing/vision, and intangibles/movement.
Part 1
Passing has always been an underrated part of Lionel Messi's game.  Not that anybody had dared to argue that he wasn't a particularly capable passer of the football (as mostly every La Masia graduate is), but it wasn't until last year, where adeeper, ""freer"" roleaccelerated Messi's assist numbers, that anybody seemed to be really taking notice:

Lionel Messi ""Orgasmic Passing""fromemeryzachonVimeo.
But truth is Messi has always been a kind of hybrid player, both an excellent finisher and distributor.  Coaches for his national team have always tried to figure out how to utilize Lionel's talents.  Why isolate him on the wing when he can influence so much more of the game?  Why ask him to play centre-forward when he can play theengancheposition, even better than the likes of Riquelme, Cambiasso, and Pastore?  But I'm not here to talk about Messi's positioning.  For now, I want to talk abouthowMessi passes,howhe thinks on the ball, and what makes him an evenbetter,more effective passer than even some of the midfield maestros on his own team.
""The Messi Ball""
There are basically two types of passes that Messi loves to play: aspecificpass and anon-specificpass (I'll get to that explanation in a minute).
The first one (shown in the above video) can occur in two ways, either as Messi drops deep and frequently rightward from the centre-forward positionoreven when he is not withdrawn.  The destination of Messi's pass here is to find a wide-playing forward, Villa or Pedro usually, who is playing just behind the full-back.  Now, it's important that the recipient of Messi's pass is behind the defender for a few reasons:1)The defender is unaware of the attacker's run and can't time his response to it.2)The defender is drawn to Messi, which allows Messi to discern when to make the pass.3)The defender is not ""goal side"" of the recipient as to be able to make an easier tackle.  Now, here's how it works:

Using the Arsenal game as an example, we have Villa tucking behind Sagna (the right fullback) and Messi dropped off from his centre-forward position with the ball running at the goal. Arsenal's defense now has a decision to make: do one of their centre-backs come out and confront Messi like Mourinho ordered Carvalho in theSupercopa...or do they stay still and allow Messi to run at them full-steam?  Logically, they chose to not take that risk; however, the knock-on effect is that the defense has to shift to compensate for the CB (in this scenario, it's Koscielny) approaching Messi.  What Messi is looking for when this hapens is a veryspecificlane that suddenly opens up.
Now, remember that in this example suddently the defense is shifting to the left (Messi's right).  And this can only favor one person--you got it: Villa.  Magically, Villa can hang wide and await a diagonal ball between the centre-back and fullback because there is not only space there for the pass with one less defender but the defense is suddenly out of shape.  The funny thing about this pass is that it's also the favorite pass of Xavi and Iniesta, and you used to see a lot more of it from those players when Messi was playing to the right.  And that's the key difference, andadvantage, insofar that Messi is playing the ball muchcloserto the intended target, while additionally he is drawing defenders and opening up spaces...while Xavi and Iniesta, with their deep-lying role and limited (at least in comparison to Messi) dribbling abilities, can't do as effectively.
So, yes, that is aspecificpass that Messi has developed now that his role has become more central and thusly more focal in this phenomenal Barcelona side.  But that's not the only type of pass Messi does...so what about all of those others?

I'm going to lump all of them into what I call ""non-specific Messi passes.""   With the earlier pass/assist, it's something veryspecificto Messi'sroleon the team--how he vacates space in the center of the pitch, how he draws defenders in a particular area--and while there is slight variety in it (as many of you might have anticipated, Messi's assist in the Arsenal game was when Villa was behind acentre-back--but it's roughly still thesamepass) one can basically list the permutations fairly quickly.  On the other hand, Messi does a whole lot of passing in Barcelona's games that isn't so specific; in fact, frequently he drops into midfield to just simply pass or help out because Xavi/Iniesta/Busquets are having a hard time getting the ball forward.  It's here, I think, where we realize just how talented Messi is as a team player, how he is not only capable of dribbling around the midfield in ways that Iniesta can't do but how he can just as well slot in and keep the ball ""flowing"" to the final third.
Imagine the difficulty for a defender: you not only have to getnearMessi, but you have to understand that he can just as much pass around you to beat you as dribble around you.  This is precisely why when a team bottles themselves up like Milan did this week, Messi will seemingly go full-throttle into the belly of the beast.  Yes, he's looking for an opening to get to goal--one, must never forget that he is always looking to score--but he's also asking the defenders to lose their shape to possibly create a quick ball to a Barcelona player with a space now opened up.  The brilliance of Messi is not simply that he can get into those micro-pockets that no other player on the planet can but that he canpassonce he's there.
In conclusion, passing is as much to Messi's game as dribbling. The two, in fact, are rather reliant on each other; they bolster each other because superiority at one allows even more superiority at another.  With Messi finishing last season second in Europe in assists, I don't think anybody can doubt La Pulga's remarkable talents as a world-class distributor.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mO7xNuWd8O16aoVF3mFo3ik0bRk=/0x44:917x655/320x213/filters:focal(0x44:917x655)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/photo_images/4032114/124864867.jpg

Maybe it's the dreary weather, or maybe it's the dreary football; whatever the reason, it seems as though the tabloids are hell-bent on escaping reality and want everyone else to mindlessly follow them as they continue their descent into insanity. Typically, such a descent would be ""slow"" or ""gradual""; yet in pioneering fashion the Daily Mail have broken the trend. There is no gradual descent. Rather than slowly spiral into lunacy, they've jumped right in with an absolute corker of a story:
""Lionel Messicould finally consider a move away fromBarcelonaas a consequence of his troubles with the taxman.""
Ludicrous, I know, but what if they're onto something? I mean maybe it's time for a hypothetical -- if we think it through, maybe this is quite logical and plausible?So, indulge me for a moment and imagine you are the world's greatest footballer.
Your love for football is all-consuming -- so much so that you have very little time for hair products, or releasing your own brand of underwear like some of your inferior rivals. Given how little time you have for these ground-breaking activities, it's no small wonder that you don't have enough time or effort left to properly take care of your taxes. In fact, you're so infatuated with kicking a ball that you apparently don't even have enough time to hire the right person to do that for you, and as a consequence, the state starts to pester you about paying them more money.
An inconvenience, I know.
Even with this distraction, your unabiding love for football continues so you hear the state out and give them some money, just so you can get back to playing football without interruption. You're the greatest footballer in the world remember, so you have plenty of money and you'll continue to make much more. It doesn't matter that the state will probably use it to fund the latest Florentino Perez construction project; you're just glad to get this matter behind you so you can get back to doing what you do best.
Everything is fine and dandy. You and the ball are reunited again: sunshine, lollipops and rainbows everything that's wonderful is what you feel when you're together. And then disaster strikes. The rainbow dissipates. The taxman is back, stealing your lollipop and the dark cloud of a tax evasion case blocks out the sunshine.
What would you do?
Oh shoot...even after that long-winded hypothetical, the Daily Mail story still seems stupid and illogical...in fact, it's arguably worse than that. Because what's even less logical than leaving the country in which you have raised your family to evade a tax bill? That's right! Move to another country with a higher tax bill!
According to the Daily Mail, Lionel Messi might be tempted to switch the courtrooms in Catalunya for a penthouse in Paris, France. That's France, as in the France that just approved a 75% top rate income tax. The same rate of income tax that prompted Gerard Depardieu to bid adieu to his homeland for a home in his new motherland, Russia. I mean, if you really were setting out to evade tax, you'd definitely move to a country with one of the highest rates of income tax as opposed to the nearby tax haven of Monte Carlo, right?
Right?

Alba is currently on international duty with Spain in the Nations League and is not expected to make a decision on his future until after he returns from the latest call-up.
The defender has given an interview toThe Guardianto talk about his future but wasn’t giving too much away.
“I have to see which teams want me first. And then … well, I’m open to all sorts of proposals, in Europe, outside Europe,” he explained. “Wherever I go, we’ll be fine, but it’s not easy. I want to weigh everything up.”

However, that depends on whether they can convince other high earning players to take a wage cut and/or whether they can find buyers for certain players the club does not want anymore.
The player has reportedly agreed to join for a wage around half what he earned last season in order to remain with the club that developed him. However, he has not been able to put pen to paper as Barcelona must clear salaries in order to stay under the salary cap.
If all goes according to plan, the club hopes to announce him before the German leg of their preseason tour.
Messiwill be asked to cometo begin training at the same time as the players who participated in Copa América (Sergio Agüero, Emerson Royal, and Ronald Araujo), August 3rd.
Should Messi’s renewal not be announced next week, there is no cause for panic. Barcelona have given themselves until August 31st to figure out the situation.
Messi famously asked to leave last summer, citing the lack of a competitive sporting project. He was compelled to stay in a rebuilding season in which Barcelona lifted the Copa del Rey but were swatted aside in the UEFAChampions Leagueand finished third in La Liga. New club president Joan Laporta has promised Messi that he will help rebuild the team after the disastrous reign of Josep Maria Bartomeu.

The first item on the agenda was a tribute to the Argentine star, who left in a shock move to Paris Saint-Germain after spending most of his life at the Camp Nou.
The existence of the meeting itself has been a source of controversy, with reports contradicting each other on whether club president Joan Laporta met with Jorge Messi.
But the latest rumors say that the smoke and mirrors are intentional, because the contact is supposed to be kept practically above top secret.
Of course, the biggest interest surrounding the meeting is a potential return home for the Argentine superstar, who is out of contract with PSG at the end of the season.
But the meeting was partly to soothe the relationship between the club’s top brass and the Messi tribe. It wasn’t long ago when the player’s brother, Matias, posted a video in which he claimed Laporta should be sacked and that Barcelona were a small club before the arrival of one Leo Messi.
And even if he were not to return to Barcelona next season, there is still a chance for him to attend the tribute match. Supposedly, it’s being planned for the beginning of the 2024-25 season, so in the summer of next year.

Messi has joined Mauricio Pochettino’s side on a free transfer and could link up with Kylian Mbappe and Neymar to from a fearsome looking attack.
Yet Henry says it’s not as simple as all that and that Pochettino must find the best balance to his side if they are to go on and achieve success.
“Balance is the most important thing. In a moment, we always talk about the best players, attacking, advancing. But there has to be a balance,” he said.
“We talk about the team in which I played at Barca (with Eto’o and Messi) but people forget we didn’t let in many goals. In general the teams that don’t let in many goals aren’t far from titles or Champions Leagues.
“When you have super human players it’s a bit easier but when I see how Paris are doing at the moment, they are letting in a few too many goals for me. It’s true, they’re missing players but the balance is the most important thing.”

City would be able to get him should the Argentine exercise a clause in his contract that allows him to leave for free at any point between seasons. The issue is that the clause specifies dates which correspond to the off-season in normal times, but the entire football calendar has shifted because of thecoronavirusbreak, so that the dates no longer correspond with the off-season.
If a judge does not side with Messi, who reportedly argues that the intent of the contract rather than the letter of it should be followed, then City would have to find an agreement with Barcelona for the sale.
Barcelona could point to Messi’s release clause, which is set at 700 million euro, something that no club can realistically afford after the pandemic and due to FFP rules.

Marcelo Bechler gained notoriety for breaking the news that Neymar would leave FC Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain, something that was treated skeptically by the local press when he first reported it, but eventually came to pass.
Now,he is reportingMessi wants out as well.
“At the beginning of the season he said what was important was not a big contract or money, but a strong project. And with no titles and that loss to Bayern, he still has three or four years left to play and he knows he can help Barça—but they can not help him.,” Bechler said.
“He is angry with the board and disappointed with the club and wants to leave now. Barça are pessimistic because they can’t offer a solid project and can’t do much to help him.
“It is very likely he leaves Barcelona if there is another project, I don’t know where or which club. It is impossible in this economy to pay €700 million, but I think Barça don’t want him here unhappy. After all that Messi gave to them, they don’t want him here as a prisoner.”
Despite the sacking of coach Quique Setién and technical secretary Eric Abidal, Josep Maria Bartomeu remains in charge as president.

“Players of that level are different from everyone else and the other players have to take care of them in a very special way because of their ability to make a difference. We do not know if in the future we will be lucky enough to see a footballer like Leo again.”

Santos FC claim Pelé scored 1,091 goals for them, putting him far beyond the reach of the Argentine, who would need 448 to surpass him in that case.
The number comes from counting goals scored in friendly matches, which Santos maintains are nonetheless official games.
“The matches were played in official uniforms, with the official rules of the game and with a score sheet,” says Santos’ statement.
“A goal against Transvaal (from Suriname) has the same value as a goal scored at Real Madrid, in the middle of the Santiago Bernabéu.”
However, modern convention holds that goalscoring records count competitive games for clubs only. International friendlies are also counted, apart from competitive internationals, but of course, that does not come into play in this particular record.
Interestingly, Pelé himself recognized that Messi had surpassed him.
“Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel. But above all, congratulations on your beautiful career at FC Barcelona,” the Brazilian legend wrote.

FCBarcelonapresident, Josep Maria Bartomeu, gave the media a lot of time during an interview on Wednesday afternoon. Bartomeu opened it with a quick statement about his plans for the immediate future, including ticket sales, social efforts and business decisions. Then, the president answered questions. A LOT of questions. He responded to all of them, and was honest and clear about his answers. Well, not including transfers, but you know how it goes ...
On his opening statement, Bartomeu talked about the expansion plans. He wants to add qualified people to the board of directors, to help improve decision-making and marketing and bussiness strategies. He talked about some social projects and promised a record on ticket sales for next season.
Then, it was time togive the people what they want. Here are some highlights of his answers:
Lionel Messi
""He's not transferable. He is not going to be sold under any circumstances. We love Leo and he is the guy we're working with, because he is the key to the rebuilding project we are into. That's why we adapted his contract, he is very happy. I know that he doesn't want to leave and he knows that he is our leader. I wish good luck to him and Argentina in theWorld Cup.""
Luis Suárez and meeting withLiverpoolofficials
""We are working on a deep rebuilding of our team, so I can't tell you exactly what signings are we negotiating. There are things going on but I can't tell you.""
""We've been on a lot of trips for months but I can't explain it. We are trying to be as cautious as possible"".
""Suárez is a Liverpool FC player. He is not one of our players, so I can't comment on him too much. What I will say is: I think it's very important that he apologized. It's honorable for a person to admit he's wrong when he makes mistakes. I understand that things can happen in the heat of competition, but it's important to his career, whether it's at Liverpool or anywhere else, it's important for him to admit that he was wrong and apologize. I'm happy for him"".
Transfers
""Like I said, we can't comment on our transfers until they're official. You know we've signed Ter Stegen, Bravo and Rakitic, but there are nothing else official yet. I can tell you that there are a lot of negotiations advancing well, and we expect them to happen. As for the center-backs, Zubi told me he has the names and the talks are advancing but we won't reveal anything.""
""We have the money to complete all signings we are planning. It can be exactly what I told you (around 150 million euros). It can be more, it can be less. But I assure you we have the money to complete every operation.""
""We have all the names, yes. We're negotiating and we're happy with how it's going. I can't reveal the names, but we have them. The negotiations get a little tricky during the World Cup because teams want to wait to see if their players value is going up, but that won't stop us. We are negotiating and the signings are happening soon"".
Xavi
""Everybody has some opinion on the 'Xavi Subject'. We will respect his decision, doesn't matter what it is. We trust him, we love him and we believe he is the greatest player and representative of this great institution. He has earned the right to do whatever he wants and we will respect his decision. And I can guarantee you he's coming back in the future, because we believe he is going to be an amazing manager for us.""
Cesc Fàbregas
""We are sad he is leaving. We loved him, and we tried everything we could to sign him when Pep Guardiola asked for him. We always treated him well and he's done the same with us. It's probably a good career move to him to joinChelsea. I wish him the best.""
There you have it, folks. What do you think of Bartomeu's interview? Do you like his answers?

Messi will remain in Rosario until Wednesday treating the problem, before having to travel back to Catalonia where he's expected to testify about his tax evasion allegations.

The Messi link isn't surprising at all, given that Leo became the best player of all time thanks in large part to Pep's master plan to use the Argentine as a False Nine, where Messi turned into a goalscoring machine and the greatest footballer we have ever seen. Pep adores Messi, and would certainly love to work with him again.
Neymar's rumored negotiations are also not surprising, given that the Brazilian himself confirmed he spoke to ""many clubs"" over the summer. City surely were one of them, but the biggest offer came from Paris Saint-Germain, and Neymar declined them all to sign a new contract with theBlaugrana.

The rumours appear to have originated fromTyC Sportsin Argentina who state that Messi will only play if he is feeling 100% fit and that he felt some discomfort.
Mundo Deportivoare also on the case and cite a report from Argentinian newspaper Ole who reckon that he has “slight muscular fatigue in the adductor area.”
Messi apparently hasn’t been ruled out of the game yet and there’s a suggestion he could start but come off early.
Of course if he is carrying a problem it seems crazy to risk him at all in what is essentially a meaningless friendly.
Although Ernesto Valverde has opted to rest Messi on the odd occasion this season he has still featured in 38 games in all competitions for Barcelona.
Barcelona also have a really busy April and will need Messi at his best when he returns from his time with Argentina. The club have a Copa del Rey final to think about,Champions Leaguegames with Roma and important La Liga fixtures.
Let’s hope the problem, whatever is it, is not too serious and that he returns from international duty unscathed.

The promise? That if they win the tournament next year, they will walk from Rosario, Messi’s hometown, down to San Nicolás, a journey of about 68km that would take around 14 hours to complete.tak
Journalist Martín Arevalo was the one who proposed it:
“Leo, let’s make a promise together if you are up for it. I have faith in the national team. We go walking to San Nicolás if we are champions, are you up for it?”
Messi’s response? “Obviously.”
They then shook hands, on it, so it’s legit.
Arevalo brought it up to Manchester City’s Agüero, as well, who agreed to it, sarcastically saying it would be a short walk.
Arevalo: If the #10 promised to go to San Nicolás, you’re in too, right?
Agüero: That’s close to Rosario, San Nicolás. it’s on the way to Buenos Aires.
Arevalo: I’m going. Are you coming, if we’re World Champions? You can say no.
Agüero: Sure. Let’s go. Where do we leave from?
Arevalo: Messi’s house
Agüero: And where do we go to?
Arevalo: To San Nicolás. It’s only 50 km.

The Brazilian winger was quoted byEsporte Interativoas saying: “Messi is always like that. He has an incredible level, but he doesn’t scare anyone. We are ready and we have the best players in the world.”
This led to headlines saying that Vinícius stated that “Messi doesn’t scare anyone,” a controversial and provocative headline to be sure.
The player himself took to Twitter to offer his version of what he said, which is: “Messi is amazing, he does things that few players are able to do, but he doesn’t scare us. We’re ready for anything that comes. We have the best players in the world as well.”
This version softens the phrase from “he doesn’t scare anyone” to “he doesn’t scare us.”
The winger is set to play his second clásico after debuting in the first leg of this Copa del Rey tie, which ended in a 1-1 draw. With a win or a 0-0 draw,Real Madridwill go through.Barcelonaneed to win or draw the match having scored at least two goals. Another 1-1 draw would lead to extra time and penalties.
Diario ASsays Barcelona have developed an “anti-Vinícius” plan to stop the Brazilian, who has become a sensation for Madrid. Meanwhile, all eyes are on Messi, who had a superhuman performance over the weekend in Barcelona’s 4-2 comeback win overSevilla.

There have been rumors already that Messi will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season when his contract at the club expires.
It’s not clear what Messi’s plans are, and it’s thought he won’t make a decision until after the World Cup, but Romeu says that Barca could afford to bring the GOAT back.
“It would be possible financially because if he returned it would be as a free agent,” he said.
“But it’s a decision which has to be made by the coaching staff and the player. It doesn’t correspond to me [to make those decisions], but it would be viable.
“We have completely changed the structure. From having players with high level of salary and an already large squad at the average age level, we have gone on to have players with projection and market levels, which will surely be important.
“Without boasting, we have saved Barca, but the club is not economically healthy yet. There’s still a need for austerity and there is a lot of work to do.
“[I predict] Barca will be healthy within five years [of our mandate]. In the 24-25 season, we will be at the level we should be.”

https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2011/3/25/2071763/lionel-messi-vs-ronaldinho-pep-guardilola-vs-frank-rijkaard,Lionel Messi vs. Ronaldinho: Pep Guardilola vs. Frank Rijkaard,188.74.210.21,"Mar 25, 2011","The penultimate comparison in the Rijkaard versus Guardiola series is between the two superstars.

On one side we have the 1-time Ballon D’Or winner and 2-time FIFA World Player of the Year winner, Brazilian legend Ronaldinho, trademark smile and all.

On the other we have the 2-time Ballon D’Or winner and 1-time FIFA World Player of the Year winner, the diminutive Argentine known as Lionel Messi.
Where to start? Both invoke smiles when raised with a Blaugrana fan, or grimaces with a Madrista. Both were the ""superstar"" of their respective side and both have won all there is to win, at club level anyway.

So, on paper, these two are pretty even.

Though, look closer, and it’s not really the case.

Ronaldinho was signed by Joan Laporta, but it may never have been the case. Laporta was elected into office having promised the signing of David Beckham, but hey, who’s complaining?

Upon arrival he rejuvenated a side that had slipped to 6thplace the year previous, and in his first season he led the team to a second place finish, despite being hampered by injuries. The next season, he helped the team go one better and in his time with Barcelona he won 2 La Liga titles, 2 Super Cups and of course, the Champions League in 2006.

He was a true legend at the club, his passing was fantastic, everyone knows of his dribbling skills, and he was also a great goal scorer. The heir to Zidane’s crown as the best player in the world, Ronnie amassed 110 goals in his time with Barcelona, in addition to 80 assists. He also scored that memorable goal against Chelsea:
Andres Iniesta Goal vs. Chelsea (viaPrimeTime2912)

Damn it! Not that one! This one!

ronaldinho goal vs chelsea (viabluearmy06)
He can also claim to be one of, if not the only opposition player, let alone Barca player to receive a standing ovation from the Bernabeu crowd after his brace in a famous 3-0 victory.
But comparing him to Messi? No way.


Don’t get me wrong, Ronaldinho is in the 99 percentile of players to have ever played the game, but Messi is in the top 1 players!
He first burst onto the scene under Rijkaard, with a Maradona-esque goal versus Getafe in which he ran 62 yards and beat 6 players (goalkeeper included). And since then?
Wow!
His stats dwarf those of Ronaldinho, he has scored more goals, and this season, has more assists too. How can you compare the leading goal-scorer and assistor in the world to anyone?

If I took the best attributes of Ronaldinho – dribbling, passing, movement, free-kicks etc. – it is arguable that Messi is better at them all. He is not perfect, but appears to be pretty darn close from a footballing perspective.

What I would have loved to see though, is a Ronaldinho is his prime playing with the present-day Messi. One can only imagine the joy it would be to watch, unless you are a Real fan that is!

I'm just glad that they both chose to spend some time at Barcelona, but there is a clear winner, and that's Messi.
Winner: Lionel Messi

After carrying the nation on his back all the way to a final only to lose it for the third straight year, Messi had enough, and he called it a career with theAlbiceleste.
The world was shocked by Leo's decision, and the people from Argentina immediately started a campaign to try and convince the Barcelona superstar to come out of his retirement and continue playing for his nation. He remained firm for about two months, and his decision caused a lot of changes in the national team, which included manager Tata Martino being fired.
In came Edgardo Bauza to replace Martino, and his appointment was not a source of excitement for Argentineans. He had only coached in South America for his entire career, and big names like Diego Simeone, Mauricio Pochettino and Marcelo Bielsa were ahead of him in the pecking order, but said no to the job, which meant Bauza was the last resort.
Then Bauza traveled to Catalonia one night, most specifically the Joan Gamper Trophy match between Barcelona and Sampdoria at Camp Nou. A few hours after the game, a surprising announcement: Lionel Messi had decided to return to the national team.
So why did Messi make that decision, and how did Bauza convinced him to be anAlbicelesteagain? The coach says he didn't do much:
""First we asked him if he would receive us. When he accepted, I knew that there would be no problem with him because it was going to be a chat about football. I didn't go to convince Messi, I was convinced that in the chat a possibility would arise. He received me with Javier Mascherano at theCiutat Esportivaand after the chat there was nothing more to say other than 'Boys, you're called up for the next game.'""
Messi is currently injured and not able to play for Argentina, but he did work with Bauza for a week last month, and Leo's incredible football IQ was very surprising to the manager:
""What surprised me is how much he knows about football, because he knows everything, about his team-mates, the technical team, about football. He's aware of everything. I always thought a player of his standing would have to be a player who knew a lot about football. But he surprised me even more than I thought. Leo knows everything about everything. Nothing escapes him. He has a very important understanding and this helps when one has to communicate their idea.""

The Argentine scored his seventh inBarcelona’s 3-0 victory over Deportivo Alavés, this time sliding it under the wall and past Fernando Pacheco in goal. He also hit the post with a curling effort that almost crept into the top corner, and in the Spanish Supercup, he once again hit the post through a free-kick, though this time it was followed up by Gerard Piqué who tapped it into an empty net.
Is Messi the best free kick taker in the world? There’s certainly a good chance given the stats, and the fact is that even when he misses by hitting the post or forcing a save, the danger is not always passed for the opposition. Not only did Piqué score one off the post this season already, but he got close to doing it again against Alavés, but he couldn’t direct his header back into the net.
The astonishing thing is Messi has improved markedly at his free-kick technique. In fact, he has scored more free-kicks after turning 28 years old than before. He made his debut for Barcelona at 17, and he’s 31 now.

Is a reunion possible?,154.95.36.199,"Dec  3, 2020","Neymar’s declaration that he would like to play once again with his former teammate Lionel Messi has led the papers to ask whether such a reunion is possible.
The short answer seems to be yes, although it’s not necessarily likely.
Barcelona’s interim president, Carles Tusquets, said Neymar could come, but only on a free transfer, unless Barcelona can raise money through sales.
“If he comes free, it could be done, but if we don’t sell, there is no money to sign anyone. At this moment it would be unaffordable, unless the next president has a miracle in his hands,” he said.
Neymar is on a five year deal with Paris Saint-Germain that expires in 2022.
Mundo Deportivoreckons that PSG could entice Messi to come the other way. They say the Parisian club is one of the few clubs in the world that could offer him the money he gets at Barcelona. In addition, they have a team that is dominant in the domestic league and made the UEFAChampions LeagueFinal last season.
Ángel Di María, a friend of his, plays there, and so does his compatriots Mauro Icardi and Leandro Paredes. Another possible reason for Messi to join is that Ligue 1 is considered less physical, and he could rest more games because PSG usually cruise to the league title. Finally, the city of Paris itself could be an attractive proposition for the Argentine.
On another front, one of the main candidates for the Barcelona presidency, said he was not worried about Neymar’s statements.
“It is normal for him to say it, they are friends and have an established hierarchy between them. This relationship is normal,” Jan Laporta said.
Laporta said he didn’t want to say too much because he feared “destabilizing the team,” but that he was working on improving Barcelona and enticing Messi to stay.
“I hope that Leo can wait and listen to the proposal of the new president of Barcelona,” he said.
A last possibility would be a third club getting them both, although it seems difficult with the way the football economy is doing that a team could afford to bring both in.

Santos FC claim Pelé scored 1,091 goals for them, putting him far beyond the reach of the Argentine, who would need 448 to surpass him in that case.
The number comes from counting goals scored in friendly matches, which Santos maintains are nonetheless official games.
“The matches were played in official uniforms, with the official rules of the game and with a score sheet,” says Santos’ statement.
“A goal against Transvaal (from Suriname) has the same value as a goal scored at Real Madrid, in the middle of the Santiago Bernabéu.”
However, modern convention holds that goalscoring records count competitive games for clubs only. International friendlies are also counted, apart from competitive internationals, but of course, that does not come into play in this particular record.
Interestingly, Pelé himself recognized that Messi had surpassed him.
“Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel. But above all, congratulations on your beautiful career at FC Barcelona,” the Brazilian legend wrote.

The promise? That if they win the tournament next year, they will walk from Rosario, Messi’s hometown, down to San Nicolás, a journey of about 68km that would take around 14 hours to complete.tak
Journalist Martín Arevalo was the one who proposed it:
“Leo, let’s make a promise together if you are up for it. I have faith in the national team. We go walking to San Nicolás if we are champions, are you up for it?”
Messi’s response? “Obviously.”
They then shook hands, on it, so it’s legit.
Arevalo brought it up to Manchester City’s Agüero, as well, who agreed to it, sarcastically saying it would be a short walk.
Arevalo: If the #10 promised to go to San Nicolás, you’re in too, right?
Agüero: That’s close to Rosario, San Nicolás. it’s on the way to Buenos Aires.
Arevalo: I’m going. Are you coming, if we’re World Champions? You can say no.
Agüero: Sure. Let’s go. Where do we leave from?
Arevalo: Messi’s house
Agüero: And where do we go to?
Arevalo: To San Nicolás. It’s only 50 km.
Agüero: Oh, no problem then. We’ll jog there

TheBarcelonaboss talked about resting Lionel Messi, the title race, theChampions League,Antoine Griezmannand Ousmane Dembele.
Here are the best bits:
Valverde on resting Lionel Messi
There is never an ideal time to rest a player like him. But we’ll see tomorrow. We think this match is very important. Many are looking ahead to Atletico Madrid, but the three points on offer in this match are much the same as those on offer against Atletico.
Valverde on Malcom and Coutinho
These are situations that happen during the season. Sometimes one player is better than another, sometimes it’s the other way around in terms of form. Everyone always talks about forwards, but what we are expecting and hoping for is the best Coutinho, the best Malcom and the best Dembele
Valverde on Dembele
I’m not completely certain when we will have him back. It might be Saturday, it might be against Man Utd. I can’t give an exact date, but around about that time.
Valverde on Griezmann
The fact he is being spoken about is not destabilising for us or for Atletico, It’s just the same as last year. People always talk about our players as well, it’s habitual.
Valverde on La Liga
We have nine more games if we win six we’ll be champions, that’s the reality. The best thing to do is keep putting away game after game. Having to win six games only doesn’t mean we’ve won the league we still have to do a lot before that hpppens.
Valverde on Villarreal
Our opponents are going through a difficult situation. They were winning 2-0 the other day and then ended up losing to Celta Vigo. They’re far down the table, but have had many good matches against the likes of Sevilla, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, plus they’re in the Europa League quarter-finals. It’s often tough for us to beat them.
Valverde on the Champions League
Historically when Barca have won the Champions League, they’ve won La Liga too. I know that’s a competition which the fans love, the players and everyone, but the Champions League can betray you in any game, in 15 bad minutes.
By contrast, in La Liga, you judge yourself from the first minute to the last of the season. It’s our bread and butter, it’s how you judge yourself each week.

However, Benedito says the deal is not valid without Messi’s signature and wants the president to explain the situation.
""Bartomeu's said that the contract is signed and it's just lacking the protocol. That contract, without Leo's signature, is not valid.
“Even though his father has signed, it needs the player's signature. This doesn't help with getting it signed. It's possible that Bartomeu's presence is the main obstacle [for getting it signed].
“I hope that the president explains everything truthfully. It's not the first time he's lied.""

“I have been experiencing problems with my hamstring for some time now. We decided to clean everything in the face of what is coming. I am optimistic to play against Spain on Tuesday,” he said.

While it’s good to see Messi not being risked against Italy it’s still a little worrying to hear that he’s carrying an injury and considering playing against Spain.

Previously, Gerard Romero, a well-informed Barcelona-based journalist, had said that Barcelona were in pole position to get his signature, contrary to most reporting at the time.
Gastón Edul, one of the most connected Argentine journalists, initially made it clear he believed Messi would stay at PSG. But he since has admitted that he was no longer as certain as before that Messi would renew his deal.
Romero continued to say on his Twitch stream that at the moment, Messi was not keen on staying in Paris. That would open up other options - a return to Barcelona, a chance to play in the MLS with Inter Miami, or a turn to play in his own country, Argentina, with Newell’s Old Boys.
Romero has stressed that while the door for a return is open, nothing is certain at all, and it’s still entirely possible that he will extend his contract with the Parisians.
There is also the question of whether Barcelona will be able to afford Messi’s salary, considering their troubles with La Liga’s strict Financial Fair Play controls. Romero stressed that something could be worked out given how much more income the player would bring to the league.
Finally, there is the tense relationship between his agent and father, Jorge Messi, and Barcelona’s president, Joan Laporta. In fact, it is the father who seems most opposed to a return to Barcelona.

TheBarcelonacaptain made his first appearance since theCopa Americaand opened the scoring early on in the game after winning a penalty following a foul by Alex Sandro.
Goalkeeper Alisson actually saved Messi’s spot-kick but could not prevent the forward from tapping home the rebound on 13 minutes.
Brazil had already missed a penalty of their own by that point. Gabriel Jesus calmly rolled his spot-kick just wide after being brought down by Leandro Paredes minutes earlier.
There were no other goals in a sloppy first half, although Messi did force Alisson into another save with a low shot from distance just before half-time.
The second-half predictably saw a raft of substitutions. Arthur went off on 55 minutes and was replaced by Liverpool midfielder Fabinho.
Messi went close to grabbing his second with a free-kick on 66 minutes. The GOAT curled an effort over the ball but saw Alisson just manage to tip it over the crossbar.
The Liverpool goalkeeper also had to be alert to push a shot from Paredes over the bar after good work from Germán Pezzella, while Lautaro Martinez fired a good chance over shortly afterwards.
Brazil had a chance to grab a late equaliser in stoppage time when Rodrygo crossed for Wesley, but he was let down by a poor first touch as Argentina secured the win.
La Albiceleste now go on to to face Uruguay in Israel on Monday, while Brazil play South Korea in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola has signed a new contract atManchester Citywhich has instantly fuelled more rumors Messi could head to the Premier League next summer.
Trincao has now offered a bit of insight into how he sees Messi at Barcelona.
“I see Leo being calm in the dressing room, and he’s always eager to train. I think we’ll continue to enjoy Leo at Barça for a long time.”
The youngster was also asked about coach Ronald Koeman and his playing time at Barcelona. Trincao has yet to make his first start but is hoping for more chances off the bench.
“I think having a little more minutes and, little by little, working, I will have more peace of mind and I will be able to show my quality in the games,” he added.
“He’s [Koeman] a great coach. Age doesn’t matter, just performance and whoever wins it in training plays. Too easy. He says it so that we can do our work without fear and that we enjoy.”

Sky Sportsreportsthat the Argentine star is not thinking about leaving at all, despite rumored interest from superclubs. Instead, he reportedly wants to remain until at least his current deal expires, 2021, but would be open to extending it further.
Messi has publicly stated in the past he will evaluate year by year whether he can continue at the highest level.
There is some controversy about the clause in Messi’s contract which supposedly would allow him to leave for free starting next summer. Some reports have said the free release clause only applies to clubs outside of Europe, although other reports do not say that is a limitation.
Even if it was limited to a move to a non European team, one wonders whether, for example, an Asian team could sign him for free and put him up for sale to a European club right after. Of course, in any scenario, the player himself would have to agree to the move.

La Albiceleste did hit back in the second half. Messi sent a free-kick into the box for Sergio Aguero to head past Martín Campaña on 63 minutes.
Yet they were only level for five minutes as Suarez fired Uruguay ahead in style. The Barcelona striker curled a free-kick over the wall and into the roof of the net to make it 2-1.

If that is true, that makesFC Barcelonathe clear favorite for his signature.
According to RMC Sport,“unless the situation changes, the Argentinian will leave Paris.”
There was at some point a general agreement on a contract extension, but Messi never put pen to paper. And as time has gone on, the relationship strained, and Messi’s flirting with Barcelona has made PSG de-prioritize the renewal. That means that at the moment PSG are not working as strongly on getting him to stay. But even if they were to prioritize the extension once more, there is no guarantee that Messi will agree to stay.
And over at FootMercato, they say “he already sees himself returning to Catalonia.”
His relationship with the manager, Christophe Galtier, has been strained. And he has not liked the way some PSG supporters - a minority, sure, but a good number - single him out when the team does not produce results in Europe.
His family wants to return to Barcelona, where they are comfortable. And it seems the player himself is willing to turn down bigger offers to play for Barcelona. That will be critical as Barcelona deals with a financial crisis that has made it hard for the team to stay within La Liga’s strict Financial Fair Play and salary cap rules.
Outside of Barcelona or PSG, there are no strong rumors linking him to another European club. Instead, his plan B would be either the Saudi League or MLS, specifically Inter Miami. But it’s said that the current FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner and FIFA The Best winner, and favorite for the Ballon d’Or does not see him outside of the top five leagues yet.

If that is true, that makesFC Barcelonathe clear favorite for his signature.
According to RMC Sport,“unless the situation changes, the Argentinian will leave Paris.”
There was at some point a general agreement on a contract extension, but Messi never put pen to paper. And as time has gone on, the relationship strained, and Messi’s flirting with Barcelona has made PSG de-prioritize the renewal. That means that at the moment PSG are not working as strongly on getting him to stay. But even if they were to prioritize the extension once more, there is no guarantee that Messi will agree to stay.
And over at FootMercato, they say “he already sees himself returning to Catalonia.”
His relationship with the manager, Christophe Galtier, has been strained. And he has not liked the way some PSG supporters - a minority, sure, but a good number - single him out when the team does not produce results in Europe.
His family wants to return to Barcelona, where they are comfortable. And it seems the player himself is willing to turn down bigger offers to play for Barcelona. That will be critical as Barcelona deals with a financial crisis that has made it hard for the team to stay within La Liga’s strict Financial Fair Play and salary cap rules.
Outside of Barcelona or PSG, there are no strong rumors linking him to another European club. Instead, his plan B would be either the Saudi League or MLS, specifically Inter Miami. But it’s said that the current FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner and FIFA The Best winner, and favorite for the Ballon d’Or does not see him outside of the top five leagues yet.

He had previously returned to training alone and missedBarcelona’s opener against Athletic Club Bilbao.
He was training alone this morning but rejoined the group in the afternoon. It’s been 16 days since his calf muscle injury, but it seems the player could be ready to be a part of the next match in La Liga.
It remains to be seen how he does in the next few days of training, which will dictate how much he can play, if at all. The timing of the injury means he missed out completely on preseason so his fitness levels may be relatively low as well. One possibility is that he comes off the bench.
Ernesto Valverde also called up B team players Iñaki Peña, Chumi, Carles Pérez, and Abel Ruiz, in addition to Juvenil A player Ansu Fati, for the training session.

“All teams are having a hard time starting of the season. It is not a criticism, it is a reality, but when you travel in pre-season, you do not train well. We understand why the club has to play these matches, which is necessary and all the big teams do it, but we need time to catch up.
“I am happy to be able to play the first 90 minutes of the season. I felt tired, but well and wanted to finish the game. For me it is very important to play games. It’s how I get ready, because with so many games we can barely train.”

Alena says Messi helped him settle and told him how to handle the pressure of playing for the first team.
“He acts like a captain and he helped me a lot when I came into the setup. He told me to play quietly because there’s always pressure in the first team, but in the end you play with stars. He made me feel bigger, he’s a really nice guy.
“I haven’t gotten used to it, because it’s all happening so fast but I’m enjoying it a lot. I’ve been at the club for 14 years and I’ve seen my idols a thousand times on TV or on the pitch, I share experiences with them now on a daily basis in the dressing room and on the pitch. It’s a dream come true and I’m learning a lot.”
