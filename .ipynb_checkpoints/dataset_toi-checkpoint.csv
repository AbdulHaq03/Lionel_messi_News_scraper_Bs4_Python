The kind of money that Argentina command (as appearance fee) is huge and we have limitations in terms of our economic situation in football.”Congratulations!You have successfully cast your voteLogin to view resultPablo Joaquin Diaz, head of international relations, represented the Argentina FA in talks with AIFF.Since winning the World Cup, Argentina has become the most in-demand football team with Messi’s team commanding a fee of $4-5 million (approx. Rs 32-40 crore).Argentina’s initial plan was to play two friendlies in South Asia: one in India and another one in Bangladesh, but none of the countries could come up with the necessary funds at short notice, prompting the world champions to play Australia in Beijing on June 15 and Indonesia in Jakarta on June 19.The world champions are understood to have passed on the chance to play friendlies in the United States during this window as it embarks on a plan to capitalise on its global appeal.Given the disparity in rankings between Argentina and India, AIFF would have had to arrange another team to play the world champions. Argentina are ranked world no 1 while India are ranked hundred places behind at 101.“There would have been too much of a mismatch if India played (Argentina),” said Prabhakaran.Diaz, head of international relations at the Argentina FA, has continued talks with Prabhakaran and the two countries could, sooner or later, arrive at an understanding over a partnership.“We are interested in having some sort of partnership with the Argentina FA. There is lot of interest from Argentina too, even from their clubs,” said Prabhakaran.Early this year, Argentina’s Ambassador to India, Hugo Javier Gobbi, gifted Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan a national team jersey in appreciation for the state’s support for Argentina during the World Cup in Qatar.Argentina have played in India before: in 2011 when Messi captained the team to a solitary goal win against Venezuela at the Salt Lake stadium where 85,000 spectators watched and then went home delirious with joy.This time around, India would have seen Messi and Argentina as world champions for the first time, but at a huge cost.",https://static.toiimg.com/photo/25581306.cms

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/la-liga-prepares-for-life-without-lionel-messi/articleshow/77984428.cms, La Liga prepares for life without Lionel Messi ,45.155.68.129,"Sep 07, 2020","PANAJI: For 10 days, almost everyone had their heart in the mouth as Lionel Messi pondered over his future at Barcelona.The world’s best footballer and winner of six Ballon d'Or titles officially informed his club that he was leaving as per a clause in the contract that allowed him to walk away for free at the end of each season. Barcelona stood firm, and in the end, Messi was forced to do a rethink.First it was Neymar (PSG), then Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus), and if Messi too had walked away from La Liga, the league would have looked poorer in just three years. The league, though, looks at individuals differently.Congratulations!You have successfully cast your voteLogin to view result“We know that the retirement of Messi will bring an end (to his career in Spain), but we do hope that it’s an impact we will be able to overcome easily and La Liga will continue to grow,” Jose Antonio Cachaza, managing director, LaLiga India, told TOI on Monday.Cachaza was speaking to journalists in the subcontinent about the Spanish league’s 90th season which kicks off on Friday. The fixtures show that first match-up between Barcelona and Real Madrid will be played on October 25 at the Camp Nou, almost certainly without another star, Luis Suarez.“Leo is the best player in the world, and for many, the best player in history. They are players, though, who are approaching the end of their careers. Players come and go, sadly. Clubs stay, league stays,” said Cachaza.For nine seasons, when Ronaldo was at Real Madrid before his high-profile move to Juventus, his battles with Messi on the field made news across the world and gave the league a different identity. Their rivalry has remained unmatched.“We will always remember, not just Leo, but also Cristiano, both of whom gave us one of the most exciting competition ever in team sports. Nothing compares to what these two guys gave to the league for 10 years, except maybe for Magic Johnson and Larry Bird (in NBA) in the eighties.“It was something unique. Life will continue and we are planning for the future, no wonder, knowing that these players will be replaced by other great players,” said Cachaza.The La Liga since its inception 90 years ago has always seen the world’s best footballers in action. “There was life before Messi and there will be life after Messi,” pointed out Cachaza, in his own words providing the examples of Alfredo di Stefano in the 1950s, Johan Cruyff in the 1970s, Diego Maradona in the 1980s, and Zinedine Zidane at the turn of the century.“For the last 10 years, we were blessed to have the two best players in the world. Again, as I said, they are approaching at the end of their careers and La Liga will keep growing. Football at large will keep growing.“It’s always sad when you lose the best player in the world. When Cristiano left, obviously in terms of the competition, it was a relevant loss. But in terms of the growth of the business, it had no impact,” said Cachaza.",https://static.toiimg.com/photo/25581306.cms
